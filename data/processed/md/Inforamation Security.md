## FOREWORD

The  increased  adoption  of  Information  Technology  (IT),  electronic  communications, and cyberspace -comprising a global network of interdependent information technology  infrastructures,  telecommunications  networks,  and  computer  processing systems  -  has provided organizations in the UAE with a platform for delivering innovative services  and  stimulating  economic  development,  as  well  as  facilitating  collaboration and  communications  among  individuals.  Our  dependence  on  these  technologies  will continue to grow in the future, and therefore, the UAE Government is committed to the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure for UAE organizations and individuals to realize the full potential of its benefits, in the face of an evolving set of related cyber threats.

As  cyber  threats  such  as  hacktivism  and  cybercrime  evolve,  so  must  our  efforts  to defend against them in a coordinated and systematic manner. To align and direct national cybersecurity  efforts,  the  UAE  Government  created  the  National  Electronic  Security Authority  (NESA)  to  improve  our  national  cybersecurity,  and  protect  our  national information  and  communications  infrastructure.  As  part  of  this  mandate,  NESA developed the UAE Information Assurance (IA) Standards to provide requirements for raising the minimum level of IA across all relevant entities in the UAE.

The adoption of these Standards by UAE entities will sustain the benefits of a trusted digital environment for businesses and individuals across the nation. As cybersecurity is  the  shared  responsibility  of  every  organization  and  individual,  collaboration  and partnerships  between  the  Government  and  private  sector  organizations  are  key  to success. I am confident that our combined efforts will make great strides in achieving the UAE's national cybersecurity objectives and allow our nation's interests to thrive.

## 1.1 BACKGROUND

The  adoption  of  Information  Technology  (IT)  and  electronic  communication  have greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of businesses and governments within the  UAE,  and  facilitated  collaboration  of  individuals  within  the  nation  and  across  the globe. Undoubtedly, IT and electronic communication have and will continue to play a pivotal role in the economic development of the UAE and the daily life of its citizens. Therefore, the UAE stands committed to the further development of its national IT and electronic communication infrastructure, as well as its cyberspace, to support economic development  and  provide  an  environment  where  the  interests  of  its  governments, businesses, and citizens can thrive.

The benefits of this technology adoption, however, come with a rapidly evolving set of cyber threats. These threats stem from a wide range of sources - including hacktivists, issue-motivated groups, and organized cybercrime syndicates - and represent national security concerns that can potentially disrupt critical national services and compromise critical information assets.

Mitigating cyber threats, and ensuring the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure, and cyberspace, is a strategic priority for the UAE. To this end, NESA developed the UAE IA Standards as a critical element of the National Information  Assurance  Framework  (NIAF)  to  provide  requirements  for  elevating  the level of IA across all implementing entities in the UAE.

11

The  development  of  the  UAE  IA  Standards  is  based  on  regional  and  global  best practices including:

- ISO/IEC	27001:2005 'Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Requirements',
- ISO/IEC	 27002:2005 'Information  technology  -  Security  techniques  -  Code  of practice for Information security management',
- ISO/IEC	27005:2005 'Information technology - Security techniques -Information security risk management'
- ISO/IEC	27010:2012 'Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications'
- ISO/IEC	27032:2012 'Information  technology  -  Security  techniques  -  Guidelines for cybersecurity'
- NIST	 800-53	 Revision	 4 'Security  and  Privacy  Controls  for  Federal  Information Systems and Organizations'
- Abu Dhabi Information Security Standards Version 1 and Version 2, developed by Abu Dhabi Systems and Information Centre (ADSIC)
- SANS 20 Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense Version 4.1

Moreover the development was guided by key principles including:

- Applicability of the common IA requirements across industries , and applicability of the sector-specific IA requirements across entities within each CIIP sector
- Support for the development of the entity, sector, and national-level views of cyber security,  to  address  potential  IA  risks  that  emerge  from  the  interconnectivity  of entities and sectors
- Support the performance management and the evolution of the controls in these standards based on measuring and sharing effective performance indicators, as well as  contributions from key stakeholders to support the ongoing development and refinement of these Standards

Compliance  with  these  Standards  will  raise  the  level  of  national  IA  and  help  the UAE  progress  towards  a  more  resilient  national  information  and  communication infrastructure, and cyberspace. All UAE government entities and other entities identified as critical 1  by NESA are obligated to implement these Standards. However, NESA highly recommends all entities in the UAE to adopt these Standards on a voluntary basis, as applicable, in order to participate in raising the nation minimum-security levels.

1  The process for NESA to designate an entity as 'critical' is outlined in the UAE Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Policy produced by NESA.

## 1.2 PURPOSE OF THE UAE IA STANDARDS

The  purpose  of  the  UAE  IA  Standards  is  to  provide  requirements  to  raise  the minimum level of protection of information assets and supporting systems across all implementing entities in the UAE, as outlined in Section 2.1.

## In particular, the UAE IA Standards provides:

- Description	of	how	information	assurance	is	achieved	at	the	national,	sector, and	entity	levels
- Enable	a	risk-based	approach	for	the	implementation	of	these	Standards
- Outline	of	the		roles	and	responsibilities	of	key	stakeholders	for	the	planning, development,	implementation,	and	ongoing	monitoring	and	improvement	of these	Standards
- Reference	catalog	of	common	information	security	controls	to	defend against	common	threats	that	exploit	known	cyber	security	vulnerabilities
- Realization	for	sectorial	requirements	through	the	provision	of	specialized controls	to	address	sector-specific	information	assurance	requirements
- Phased	implementation	approach	to	address	the	most	common	threats, facilitate	the	incremental	adoption	of	these	Standards,	and	optimize	the value	realized	through	implementation
- Definition	of	compliance	from	the	perspective	of	these	Standards	and describe	the	approach	that	will	be	adopted	by	NESA	to	assess	compliance
- Enabler	for	inter-entity	and	cross-sector	communication	to	support information	sharing	and	build	national	situational	awareness

In	summary,	the	implementation

- of	these	Standards	will	serve	to improve	the	IA	protection	level
- of	the	UAE	critical	information infrastructure.	As	such,	this
- document	serves	as	the national	UAE	IA	Standards	that
- implementing	entities	have	to demonstrate	compliance	with.

## 1.3

## LAYOUT OF THE UAE IA STANDARDS

This section provides an overview of the layout of the UAE IA Standards to guide the readability of this document.

Overall, the UAE IA Standards is composed of seven chapters:

## CHAPTER	1:	INTRODUCTION

This chapter outlines NESA's rationale for developing the UAE IA Standards and provides an overview of the document layout.

## CHAPTER	2:	UAE	IA	STANDARDS	OVERVIEW

This chapter outlines the scope of the document and describes the relationship of the UAE IA Standards with other national cyber security program documents published by NESA (e.g.  UAE  CIIP  Policy).  This  chapter  also  describes  how  information  assurance requirements are addressed at the national, sector, and entity levels following a lifecycle approach to progress the adoption and evolution of information assurance in the UAE.

## CHAPTER	3:	UAE	IA	STANDARDS	IMPLEMENTATION

This  chapter  outlines  the  implementation  guidance  for  entities  applying  the  UAE  IA Standards.  To  help  guide  the  implementation  of  these  Standards,  this  chapter  also provides  an  overview  of  the  risk-based  approach  for  the  identification  of  applicable controls to be implemented in order to address risks in a manner commensurate with their  potential  impact.  Moreover,  this  chapter  outlines  the  roles  and  responsibilities of  key  stakeholders  to  provide  clarity  on  how  to  plan,  develop,  implement,  monitor, improve,  and  report  on  the  implementation  of  these  Standards.  Lastly,  this  chapter concludes  by  outlining  critical  success  factors  for  the  effective  implementation  of these Standards.

## CHAPTER	4:	COMPLIANCE	WITH	THE	UAE	IA STANDARDS

This  chapter  provides  a  definition  of  compliance  with  respect  to  the  requirements of these Standards, and outlines the approach that NESA will follow when evaluating compliance.

## CHAPTER	5:	SECURITY	CONTROLS

This  chapter  details  the  management  and  technical  security  controls,  and  describes the prioritization approach for implementing these controls, to guide the gradual and phased implementation of these Standards.

## CHAPTER	6:	ANNEXES

This chapter provides key reference tools to help stakeholders understand and utilize the  security  controls  including:  grouping  of  controls  by  priority,  cross-referencing  of controls to equivalent controls in other key IA standards, mapping of controls against common threats they help to manage, and listing the controls that contain sector and national level requirements. Lastly, this chapter enhances the clarity of the document by providing terms and definitions and a bibliography.

## CHAPTER	7:	APPENDICES

The  appendices  are  designed  to  augment  the  common  information  assurance requirements (applicable to all sectors) with sector-specific requirements for all critical sectors as outlined in the UAE CIIP Policy.

## 2.1 SCOPE

The  UAE  IA  Standards  provides  management  and  technical  information  security controls  (henceforth  referred  to  as  'security  controls')  for  entities  to  establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance.

NESA  will  designate  the  critical  entities,  as  per  the  UAE  CIIP  Policy,  mandated  to implement the UAE IA Standards and apply its requirements to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data, and the systems and processes used for those purposes. This includes information in physical or electronic form that may be owned, leased, or otherwise in the possession, custody, or control of the entities.

## 2.3

## ENTITY, SECTOR, AND NATIONAL CONTEXTS

The  entity,  sector,  and  national  contexts  refer  to  the  integrated  relationships  and interactions  among  individual  sector  entities,  sector  regulators,  and  NESA  to  form sector and national level views on prevailing IA requirements, corresponding adequacy of IA capabilities, and on-going situational awareness.

While IA Standards that exist today prescribe requirements for the entity level, they do not take into account the IA issues that emerge from the systemic interconnectivity of entities at the sector and national levels. This leads to two key shortcomings: first, continued exposure to security threats that no single entity is able to address individually (such as Advanced Persistent Threats), and second, an isolated approach to handling risks related to inter-sector dependencies, often leading to increased efforts, cost, and risk exposure of concerned sectors.

The  UAE  IA  Standards  includes  minimum  IA  requirements  and  capabilities  for  UAE entities to integrate into the Sector and National Contexts (refer to Figure 2).

RELEVANT THREAT AND RISK INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED TO SECTOR REGULATORS AND ENTITIES

The development of the sector and national contexts relies on the consolidation and analysis of key entity level information, in particular relating to the state of the UAE IA Standards implementation, risk assessment outcomes, as well as information relating to cyber security threats, risks and incidents.  2 To enable the sector and national contexts, entities are required to submit UAE IA Standards implementation progress and key cyber security information to sector regulators, who consolidate and analyze the information to form a sector view of risks and assess the state of these Standards implementation. Similarly, sector regulators are required to submit the analyzed sector-level information to NESA, to form the national views on critical risks, situational awareness and state of these Standards implementation across sectors.

Having formed the national view of risks and state of these Standards implementation, NESA shares relevant risk and UAE IA Standards implementation best practices with the sector regulators to enhance the effectiveness of these Standards implementation, as well as the cyber incident management and the cyber risk management programs. Similarly, sector regulators share key risk and implementation related information with relevant entities to progress the implementation of these Standards, and enhance the effectiveness of the incident management and risk management programs.

In summary, the UAE IA Standards is designed to avoid the isolation created by a single-entity approach to IA, hence creating a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance.

## INFORMATION ASSURANCE LIFECYCLE

The UAE IA Standards promotes a lifecycle approach for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continuously improving information assurance. This lifecycle approach ensures continual improvement of the UAE's information assurance capabilities based on well-defined activities:

- A.  UNDERSTANDING an entity's and / or sector's information security requirements and the need to establish a policy and objectives for information security
- B.  CONDUCTING risk  assessments,  identifying  appropriate  risk  treatment  actions, and selecting controls to manage the risks
- C.  IMPLEMENTING and  operating  security  controls  to  manage  information  security risks in the context of the entity's or sector's overall business risks
- D.  MONITORING and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the information security processes and controls
- E.  ENSURING continual improvement based on objective measurements

The continuous improvement aspect of the IA lifecycle ensures that IA capabilities are continuously adapted and evolved in line with changing requirements.   The application of  the  IA  lifecycle  is  facilitated  best  when  integrated  in  the  planning  and  governance activities of an entity or sector.

## 3.1 OVERVIEW

The purpose of this chapter is to explain key concepts related to the implementation of the UAE IA Standards such as the risk-based approach to information assurance and the applicability and prioritization of security controls.  This chapter also highlights key stakeholder roles and responsibilities for the effective adoption and progression of the UAE IA Standards, and it lists critical implementation success factors.

The  implementation  of  these  Standards  is  meant  to  complement  any  existing information assurance programs at implementing entities.  This Standard represents the sole point of reference for compliance against its requirements, as measured by the criteria associated with each of its security controls.

## 3.2

## RISK-BASED APPROACH

In today's world, the cyber threat landscape is evolving rapidly at a pace where entities are challenged to keep up with the number and variety of threats.  In the face of this growing threat  landscape,  entities  need  to  adopt  practical  measures  to  defend  their  critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats.  To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them to risks, and develop corresponding appropriate treatments.

Adopting  a  risk-based  approach  ensures  that  security  controls  are  instituted  in accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude of  the  impact  that  could  result  if  critical  information  assets  are  compromised.    The risk-based  approach  briefly  outlined  in  these  Standards  summarizes  a  systematic methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level risks. It consists of eight key activities as illustrated in Figure 3.

## FIGURE 3: THE RISK-BASED APPROACH PROCESS

<!-- image -->

Performing a risk management is a key step towards the implementation of the UAE IA Standards as it helps entities identify, prioritize, and measure the effectiveness of the security controls that are needed to treat identified entity-specific risks. Critical entities implementing these Standards shall also refer to the National Cyber Risk Management Framework  (NCRMF)  which  highlights  the  National  Risk  Management  approach  and process of Critical Information Infrastructure.

## ACTIVITY 1: ESTABLISHING THE ENVIRONMENT

The risk assessment process should be initiated by establishing objectives, strategies, scope and parameters of the activities of the entity, or those parts of the entity where the risk management process is being applied. Further, criteria for assessing risks should be established in line with the entity's objectives, available resources, and the magnitude of  impact  that  could  result  from  the  compromise  of  confidentiality,  integrity  and/or availability of information assets. Topics such as authenticity and non-repudiation could also be considered based on the entity context.

## ACTIVITY 2: RISK IDENTIFICATION

The entity should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events and their causes, and the potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive list  of  risks  based on the identified information security requirements. Because a risk that is not identified at this stage will not be included in further analysis, comprehensive identification is critical.

## ACTIVITY 3: RISK ESTIMATION

Risk  estimation  involves  consideration  of  the  causes  and  sources  of  risk  in  the  form of  threats  and  vulnerabilities,  their  impacts  in  terms  of  consequences  of  a  loss  of confidentiality,  integrity  and/or  availability  of  information,  and  the  likelihood  that  the potential impacts will occur. The risk should also take into account the effectiveness and efficiency of existing controls in addressing the current level of risk.

## ACTIVITY 4: RISK EVALUATION

Risk  evaluation  involves  comparing  the  level  of  risk  found  during  the  risk  estimation activity with risk criteria established at the beginning of the process as part of establishing the context (Activity 1). The objective is to determine which risks are outside acceptable parameters and therefore require treatment.

## ACTIVITY 5: RISK TREATMENT

For each of the risks identified in the risk assessment, a number of treatment options can  be  considered  and  applied  either  individually,  or  in  combination,  for  treating  the risk.  There  are  several  options  that  are  usually  considered  for  treating  risks;  these options include:

- Risk  Reduction -  Reducing  the  risk  by  applying  security  controls.  The  selection of  security  controls  should  follow  a  risk-based  approach  by  apply  the  first  set  of security  controls  that  treat  the  highest  risks  identified  during  the  Risk  Evaluation (See 3.4 Prioritization of Controls).
- Risk Retention - Accepting the risk based on the entity's risk accepting criteria.
- Risk Avoidance - Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk.
- Risk Transfer - Transferring the risk to another party.

## ACTIVITY 6: RISK ACCEPTANCE

The risk acceptance is the decision to accept residual risk by the management of the entity. The management based on the acceptance criteria should review and approve the treat plan and the residual risk.

## ACTIVITY 7: RISK MONITORING AND REVIEW

The  results  of  the  risk  assessment  and  treatment  process  need  to  be  monitored and reviewed for ongoing risk management, and to ensure their continued suitability. The monitoring and review of information security  risks  should  be  a  planned  part  of the risk management process, and involve regular checking or surveillance as well as improvements  when  significant  changes  occur.  The  entity's  monitoring  and  review processes should encompass all aspects of the risk management process, including the  risk  criteria,  the  identified  assets,  threats,  risks,  risk  treatment  options  and security controls.

## ACTIVITY 8: RISK COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION

Communication  and  consultation  with  key  stakeholders  should  take  place  during  all stages  of  the  risk  management  process.  Therefore,  plans  for  communication  and consultation  should  be  developed  at  an  early  stage.  These  should  address  issues relating  to  the  risk  itself,  its  causes,  its  consequences  (if  known),  and  the  measures being taken to treat it. Effective external and internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required.

## 3.3

## APPLICABILITY OF CONTROLS

The concept of Applicability relates to the identification of security controls for treating entity-specific risks as outlined in [Step 5] of the risk assessment process described above (section 3.2).

The  security  controls  included  in  these  Standards  are  developed  to  treat  a  typical entity risk profile developed based on benchmark risk registers. While this common risk profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context.  Given these differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to all  entities.  Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls for the treatment of identified risks.

Prior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security controls  to  be  applicable.  However,  an  individual  entity  may  exclude  some  security controls  on  the  basis  of  the  risk  assessment  outcomes,  provided  that  adequate justification is submitted to NESA.

Moreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered 'Always  Applicable'.  Given  their  foundational  role,  the  'Always  Applicable'  security controls shall be implemented by each relevant entity regardless of its risk assessment outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a summary of 'Always Applicable' controls).

- In	summary,	the	concept	of	Applicability	identifies	the	security	controls	that are	mandatory	for	implementation	based	on	the	list	of	applicable	controls
- resulting	 from	 the	 entity	 risk	 assessment	 process,	 above	 and	 beyond	 the
- 'Always	Applicable'	controls.		In	the	absence	of	an	entity	risk	assessment,	all
- the	security	controls	detailed	in	these	Standards	are	deemed	applicable	and
- therefore	mandatory	for	implementation.

## 3.4

## PRIORITIZATION OF CONTROLS

The concept of Prioritization relates to grouping the UAE IA Standards security controls in order of importance for realizing a minimum level of information assurance protection, and for enabling a phased and incremental implementation of these Standards.

The prioritization approach of the UAE IA Standards is based on the relative impact of security controls in helping implementing entities to:

1 · Mitigate common threats · Build foundational IA capabilities Based on these criteria, the security controls are grouped into four priority levels - P1, P2, P3, and P4 in this order of importance - and the outcome of the prioritization is included in Annex 2. While all the applicable security controls across the four priority levels are mandatory for critical entities implementing these Standards, they are required to begin implementing these Standards with P1 security controls given their highest relative impact in protecting against critical threats and building foundational information assurance capabilities.

2 Critical  entities  implementing  these  Standards  may  alter  (promote  or  demote)  the suggested priority of controls based on the outcomes of their risk assessment, with the exception of top priority controls (P1), which if applicable, may be augmented but never reduced (refer to Figure 4).

## KEY STAKEHOLDERS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The  successful  implementation  and  progression  of  the  UAE  IA  Standards  is  a shared  responsibility  among  key  stakeholders.    Therefore,  planning,  development, implementation, as well as monitoring and reporting responsibilities are assigned to key stakeholders, as described in Table 2 below:

- D.  UNDERSTAND the means by which compliance with the UAE IA Standards will be measured and enforced
- E.  IMPLEMENT a measurement system to track compliance, evaluate performance in information assurance management, and provide feedback and suggestions for the improvement and refinement of the UAE IA Standards
- F.  ESCALATE critical cyber security information to sector regulators (or equivalents) to enable the development of sector and national level view of risks
- G.  PARTICIPATE , and contribute in sharing information assurance best practices and lessons learned with sector regulators and other implementing entities
- H.  ENSURE visible support and commitment from all levels of management
- I. PROVISION adequate funding for all information assurance activities

## 4.0

## COMPLIANCE WITH THE UAE IA STANDARDS

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a definition of compliance with respect to the requirements of these Standards and to outline the measurement criteria and approach that NESA will follow when evaluating compliance.

Within the context of this Standard, compliance refers to the comparison between the requirements outlined in this Standard and the actual state of implementation of these requirements within an entity. This can be measured on an individual control basis, as well as the degree of compliance of an entity overall with the complete set of requirements. Increasing the level of compliance with the security controls provided in this Standard is the key to ensuring immediate and long lasting improvements of information assurance within the UAE and the overall success of the UAE's Information Assurance program.

To  this  end,  NESA  will  ensure  that  an  effective  compliance  monitoring  scheme  is in  place  which  provides  NESA  with  the  visibility  of  the  current  status  of  compliance with this Standard and the activities needed for improving the overall security of the UAE's cyberspace.  The compliance monitoring scheme is outlined in the UAE NIAF Governance and is based on the following four elements:

## CONTROLS

All security controls specified in the UAE IA Standards need to be considered by each entity, and any entity wishing to claim compliance with these Standards shall implement these controls based on the following requirements:

- Controls  that  are  'Always  Applicable'  -  these  security  controls  are  essential  and shall  be  implemented  by  any  entity  wishing  to  claim  compliance  with  the  UAE  IA Standards.  Omission  of  any  of  these  controls  is  not  acceptable  and  constitutes non-conformity.
- Controls  that  are  applicable  based  on  the  risk  assessment  -  the  entity  shall determine  which  of  the  security  controls  provided  in  the  UAE  IA  Standards  are applicable in its particular situation based on the results of the risk assessment.  Any exclusion of these controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided such  that  the  associated  risks  have  been  accepted  by  accountable  persons  or authorizing entities.

The  overall  set  of  security  controls  that  are  'Always  Applicable'  and  those  security controls that have been determined as being applicable based on the risk assessment are 'mandatory' for the entity to implement, and will be the basis of the compliance monitoring scheme.

## SUB-CONTROLS

For each of the security controls, a set of sub-controls are specified. These sub-controls specify mandatory implementation requirements. Also, it is expected that each entity claiming compliance shall implement the selected security controls by complying with the sub-controls during the implementation process as described below.

The entity shall implement all of the sub-controls of the 'Always Applicable' security controls.  Omission of any of these sub-controls is not acceptable and constitutes nonconformity to the UAE IA Standards.

The entity can decide to not implement a sub-control of a security control identified by  the  risk  assessment,  if  this  action  is  appropriately  justified  (e.g.  following  the  risk assessment or due to decisions or circumstances in the entity), or to implement the sub-controls  in  a  different  way.    Any  deviation  from  the  sub-controls  needs  to  be justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities.

## PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Performance indicators are intended to provide entities implementing the UAE IA Standards with some basic guidelines to measure the quality and effectiveness of its compliance with the control sub-families and controls of this Standard. Entities implementing this Standard can deviate from these performance indicators, but are required to provide a reason for this deviation and to specify the new performance indicators when doing so.

For compliance with this Standard, entities need to use performance indicators to measure the quality and effectiveness of the implemented security controls.

## AUTOMATION,	THREAT/VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION	FOR	SUB-FAMILIES	OF	CONTROLS,	AND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR CONTROLS

The information on possible automation and the implementation guidance for security controls are provided for information purposes only and can be implemented as the entity prefers, without any further explanation or justification. Descriptions of typical threats and vulnerabilities are also provided for information purposes.

In summary, NESA places a high level of importance on understanding and improving the level of compliance with this Standard as one of the core elements of increasing the level of success of the UAE's information assurance program.  At the same time, NESA understands that individual entities face specific circumstances that require a certain level of flexibility to manage properly.  As such, this Standard aims to strike an appropriate balance of mandatory requirements versus suggested security controls. This is based on the risk-based approach that each entity shall develop internally in order to  make  appropriate  and  justified  decisions.  Moreover,  all  implementing  entities  are welcomed and encouraged to share their experience in regard to the implementation of the security controls.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Before  starting  the  design  and  implementation  of  information  security  within  an  entity,  it  is important to evaluate and understand both the external and internal context of this entity, since these can significantly influence the design of information security solutions.  For the external factors, this activity should include topics such as:

- A. The industry sector, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, political, natural and competitive environment, whether international, national, regional or local
- B. Key drivers and trends having impact on the information security objectives of the entity
- C. Relationships with, and dependencies of, external stakeholders

The evaluation of internal factors should address topics such as:

- A. Governance, organizational structure, roles and accountabilities
- B. Capabilities, understood in terms of resources and knowledge (e.g. capital, time, people, processes, systems and technologies)
- C. Information systems, information flows and decision making processes
- D. Relationships with, and perceptions of, internal stakeholders

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Top  management  commitment  and  its  visible  demonstration  is  one  important  contributor to the overall success of information security within an entity.  This does not mean that top management is carrying out the actions listed above themselves, but they need to ensure that the actions do take place, and that they are concluded successfully.

One  important  part  in  these  responsibilities  is  the  assignment  of  appropriate  resources, without which information security cannot succeed (see also M1.4.1 below).  Another important aspect is the connection between business goals and requirements and information security. Ideally, this is a balance between these items, and it should never be the case that information security hinders the business.  It should, of course, also not be the case that an entity takes any unjustified risks and neglects security.  The final decision what takes preference has to be taken by top management.

Management should identify the needs for internal or external specialist information security advice, and review and coordinate results of the advice throughout the entity.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The roles of the 'Information Security Manager' and the 'Information Security Committee' are important contributors to successful information security, and have therefore been defined as sub-controls.  When implementing these sub-controls, please keep in mind that it is important to address these roles, but the name and way of implementation of these roles can be chosen by the entity.

The Information Security Committee should have a leading role for information security in the entity and should be responsible for handling the important information security issues. The members of the Information Security Committee should have a sufficient understanding of information  security  for  directing,  monitoring,  and  completing  the  necessary  tasks.  Typical tasks of an Information Security Committee could be:

- A. Defining and establishing roles and responsibilities for information security
- B. Monitor the adequacy of resources to maintain and improve information security in the entity and recommend to management the acquiring of additional resources where necessary
- C. Providing input into the development, approval and implementation of information security policies and procedures

- D. Discussing practical issues regarding the implementation of information security policies and procedures and providing feedback from their respective parts of the entity
- E. Ensure that the status of information security risks is up to date and approve the updated risk assessment
- F. Recommending changes to policies and procedures based on security incidents and changes in risks
- G. Deciding the criteria for accepting information security risks and the acceptable levels of risk
- H. Identifying significant trends and changes to information security risks
- I. Review the results of performance measurement activities
- J. Reviewing audit reports and initiating appropriate corrective actions

The  Information  Security  Manager  should  be  the  focal  point  for  information  security  within the entity and should be responsible to direct the information security team (if present) and to provide valuable input into the Information Security Committee.

Additional  responsibilities,  such  as  technical  security  managers  or  asset  owners  can  also  be identified, as needed to implement information security in the entity. If necessary, roles and responsibilities should also be defined from contractors and third party users, and it should be ensured that all roles and responsibilities are reviewed periodically and kept up to date.

It  is  of  particular  importance that all people are aware of their responsibilities for information security  and  that  everybody  is  aware  of  their  duty  to  report  information  security  incidents and events..

The following guidelines should be considered for the authorization process:

- A. New facilities should have appropriate user management authorization, authorizing their purpose and use. Authorization should also be obtained from the manager responsible for maintaining the local information system security environment to ensure that all relevant security policies and requirements are met;
- B. Where  necessary,  hardware  and  software  should  be  checked  to  ensure  that  they  are compatible with other system components;
- C. The use of personal or privately owned information systems, e.g. laptops, home-computers or hand-held devices, for processing business information, may introduce new vulnerabilities and necessary controls should be identified and implemented.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Confidentiality  or  non-disclosure  agreements  should  address  the  requirement  to  protect confidential information using legally enforceable terms. To identify requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, the following elements should be considered:

- A. A definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential information);
- B. Expected duration of an agreement, including cases where confidentiality might need to be maintained indefinitely
- C. Required actions when an agreement is terminated
- D. Responsibilities  and  actions  of  signatories  to  avoid  unauthorized  information  disclosure (such as 'need to know')
- E. Ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and how this relates to the protection of confidential information
- F. The permitted use of confidential information, and rights of the signatory to use information
- G. The right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential information
- H. Process for notification and reporting of unauthorized disclosure or confidential information breaches
- I. Terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement cessation
- J. Expected actions to be taken in case of a breach of this agreement

Based on an entity's security requirements, other elements may be needed in a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement.

Confidentiality  and  non-disclosure  agreements  should  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and regulations for the jurisdiction to which it applies.

Requirements for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should be reviewed periodically and when changes occur that influence these requirements.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Entities should have procedures in place that specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law enforcement, fire department, supervisory authorities) should be contacted, and how identified information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner if it is suspected that laws may have been broken. (Refer to Information Security Events and Weaknesses Reporting T8.3). Entities under attack from the Internet may need external third parties (e.g. an Internet service provider or telecommunications operator) to take action against the attack source. Contact with authorities also could include external working groups.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Where there is a need to allow an external party access to the information systems or information of an entity, a risk assessment should be carried out to identify any requirements for specific controls. The identification of risks related to external party access should take into account the following issues:

- A. The information systems an external party is required to access
- B. The type of access the external party will have to the information and information systems, e.g.
3. 1-  Physical access, e.g. to offices, computer rooms, filing cabinets
4. 2-  Logical access, e.g. to an entity's databases, information systems
5. 3-  Network connectivity between the entity's and the external party's network(s), e.g. permanent connection, remote access
6. 4-  Whether the access is taking place on-site or off-site
- C. The value and sensitivity of the information involved, and its criticality for business operations
- D. The controls necessary to protect information that is not intended to be accessible by external parties
- E. The external party personnel involved in handling the entity's information
- F. How the entity or personnel authorized to have access can be identified, the authorization verified, and how often this needs to be reconfirmed
- G. The different means and controls employed by the external party when storing, processing, communicating, sharing and exchanging information
- H. The impact of access not being available to the external party when required, and the external party entering or receiving inaccurate or misleading information
- I. Practices and procedures to deal with information security incidents and potential damages, and the terms and conditions for the continuation of external party access in the case of an information security incident
- J. Legal and regulatory requirements and other contractual obligations relevant to the external party that should be taken into account
- K. How the interests of any other stakeholders may be affected by the arrangements

Access by external parties to the entity's information should not be provided until the appropriate controls have been implemented and, where feasible, a contract has been signed defining the terms and conditions for the connection or access and the working arrangement. Generally, all security requirements resulting from work with external parties or internal controls should be reflected by the agreement with the external party. It should be ensured that the external party is aware of their obligations, and accepts the responsibilities and liabilities involved in accessing, processing, communicating, or managing the entity's information and information systems.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

One of the most important aspects of implementing document management in an entity is to do this consistent and throughout the entity, with supporting training, awareness and also checking  that  the  document  management  controls  are  followed.  It  is  necessary  to  include templates for document management in all documentation, irrespective of the form it takes.

All  this  can  be  supported  by  using  document  management  systems  and  other  controls  to technically  ensure  that  the  necessary  actions  are  carried  out,  wherever  it  is  possible,  it  is recommended to use technical support to achieve a complete implementation.

Compliance with this control should be checked every so often, and non-compliances should be reacted to, to demonstrate that this actually is an important control everybody needs to comply with.

Particular  attention  should  be  given  to  the  protection  of  records  -  it  is  not  so  important  for records to have an author (they are often system based- and a change history (they should not change at all if they are supposed to provide evidence), but the date of issue and the integrity of the record are important items to maintain.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Entities owning, operating, and or maintaining Critical Information Infrastructure shall take into account  all  relevant  NESA's  issuances  and  guidance  with  regard  to  risk  management  when performing risk assessment (Please refer to NCRMF for further details).

The information security risk management policy should clearly define how the entity is planning to carry out the risk assessment.  In addition to the requirements stated above, the policy can, for example, contain:

- A. The level of detail of asset identification
- B. The basis of threat and vulnerability identification
- C. The scales to be used for asset valuation in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability
- D. How the likelihood that a threat exploits a vulnerability is calculated
- E. How the risks are calculated
- F. Who will be responsible to perform the risk assessment
- G. The basis of control selection
- H. How to measure the risk management performance
- I. Criteria for improving the risk management

The risk management policy should also describe the type of risk assessment the entity intends to perform, whether it is more of a higher level assessment or a detailed one (see also M2.2), and the reasons for that choice.  The decision for a particular approach should be made based on

- A. The security requirements of the entity
- B. Their current level of maturity, and where the entity eventually wishes to be (link to self-assessment)
- C. The capabilities, knowledge and resources available at this point in time
- D. The regulations given by the entity's sector or other applicable regulations

The  entity  should  be  able  to  provide  reasons  for  the  chosen  information  security  risk management approach.

The risk management policy should be communicated appropriately.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

There  is  a  lot  of  information  related  to  the  performance  of  information  security  risk assessments; therefore, this implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most important concepts. Entities should take into account relevant NESA's issuances and guidance with regard to risk management when performing risk assessment.

## LEVEL OF DETAIL OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT

Some entities might find it difficult or time consuming to conduct a detailed risk assessment. The choice of a suitable risk management approach should be taken when drafting the Information Security  Risk  Management  Policy  (refer  to  M2.1.1),  and  the  implementation  guidance  there explains the considerations the entity should take into account when deciding on a suitable way of doing information security risk management.  The entity should document these results and should be able to provide reasons for the decision taken.

An entity will only be considered as being compliant with the requirements of this Standard if they apply a suitable information security risk management policy.

## ASSET IDENTIFICATION

The assets to be considered in the information security risk assessment are all information assets, i.e. include:

- A. INFORMATION :  Databases,  files,  contracts  and  agreements,  system  documentation, research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures, etc.
- B. SOFTWARE ASSETS: Application software, system software, development tools, and utilities
- C.  PHYSICAL ASSETS: Computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media
- D.  OTHER EQUIPMENT
- E. SERVICES: Computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning
- F. PEOPLE , and their qualifications, skills, and experience
- G.  INTANGIBLES , such as reputation and image of the entity

The identified assets are summarized in the Asset Inventory (refer to T1.2.1). It might be useful to summarize assets in suitable groups (e.g. all PCs in a call center, processing the same type of information), but care should be taken to only group 'like with like' when doing so.   It is also helpful to take account of business processes, as they often can help to understand the information flow and how assets are working in the entity.

## IDENTIFICATION OF THREATS

Threats are not very dependent on the entity and its business; they are just out there trying to succeed.  When identifying threats, it can be helpful to use threat lists (e.g. those provided in this Standard, or in other standards, such as ISO/IEC 27005), and to look into incident reports (incidents are always related to threats that have been successful- and audit reports, and to keep an open mind to the latest development as new threats will continue to emerge. It is also important to not only look at threats from the outside, such as hackers or malware, but also consider inside threats.  A disgruntled employee with given access rights can often do more damage as outsiders.

## IDENTIFICATION OF VULNERABILITIES

The identification of vulnerabilities should be based on an assessment of the existing controls. To do so,  it  is  recommended  to  conduct  a  gap  analysis,  which  checks  the  controls  in  place against  this  Standard.  The  results  of  the  gap  analysis  form  an  input  in  the  identification  of vulnerabilities as well as into the assessment of the risk likelihood (see also M2.2.2 below). Any control, which has been identified as missing, not completely in place, not fully documented or not complied with identifies at least one (if not more- vulnerabilities, which might be exploited by the identified threats.

PLEASE	NOTE:	The	identification	of	threats	and	vulnerabilities	takes	place	per	each	identified	asset, so	 this	 easily	 produces	 a	 lot	 of	 information.	 To	 keep	 the	 amount	 of	 information	 manageable,	 it	 is recommended	to:

- A. Identify	threats	and	vulnerabilities	with	the	existing	controls	in	mind
- B. Identify	only	threat/vulnerability	pairs	where	the	threat	will	actually	exploit	the	vulnerability

There is a lot of information related to the performance of information security risk assessments, and  more  details  will  be  provided  in  a  separate  risk  management  document,  therefore,  this implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most important concepts.

Consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability: The first part of assessing the consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability is to identify the business importance  the  information  asset  under  consideration  has.    Damage  to  an  asset  that  is important for the business is much likelier to cause severe consequences than an asset that is not as important. Based on the business use of the asset, the consequences for a loss of the following needs to be assessed:

- A. CONFIDENTIALITY This means the information asset is only accessible to those authorized to access it
- B. INTEGRITY This means the information asset has not been modified in any unauthorized way
- C. AVAILABILITY This means the information asset is available, when needed

To make the results of this assessment comparable, scales should be used, which should have been defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1 above).

The assessment of these consequences should be done together with the business users of the information assets, as these can give important input into the process because they are aware  of  the  security  requirements  for  their  assets.  This  can  be  done  by  interviews  and/or questionnaires, but it is important to ensure that the business users understand what is asked from them.

As a result, each asset should have identified consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability..

## LIKELIHOOD	OF	THREAT/VULNERABILITY	COMBINATIONS

The input into the assessment of the likelihood that a particular threat exploits a vulnerability is based on very similar considerations as the identification of threats and vulnerabilities (see M2.2.1 above).  The likelihood of a threat occurring can be derived from threat catalogues and statistics, as well as incident records, audit logs and reports, etc. the entity has produced.

The level of vulnerability is based on how good or bad the controls are that have been put in place, so this can also be derived from the results of the gap analysis (see M2.2.1 above).  Finally, the likelihood of the threat to occur and the level of vulnerability are put together to determine the likelihood that this particular threat/vulnerability combination occurs.  How exactly these values are  put  together  has  been  defined  in  the  Information  Security  Risk  Management  Policy  (see M2.1.1. above).

Determining the levels of risk: Based on the method to calculate risks, which has been chosen by the entity and has been documented in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1. above), the risks should now be calculated using the consequences and likelihoods that have been assessed.

PLEASE	NOTE:	The	details	on	how	to	calculate	the	risks	and	which	valuation	schemes	are	used	for consequences	and	likelihood	is	entirely	up	to	the	entity	to	decide.		It	is	nevertheless	important	that	the approach	chosen	is	applied	consistently.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

There is a lot of information related to the performance of information security risk assessments, and  more  details  will  be  provided  in  a  separate  risk  management  document,  therefore,  this implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most important concepts.

Once the risks have been calculated (see M2.2.2 above), the entity should compare the risk levels assessed with the risk criteria that have been established documented in the Information Security Risk  Management Policy (see M2.1.1. above). This will  rank  the  risks  in  order  of  severity  and  will identify those that are acceptable (because they are below the general threshold of acceptance), and those risks that will require treatment.

If necessary, the entity can assign additional priorities to the risks, e.g. if a risk - despite of not being high- relates to a very vital business process.  Any such assignment is entirely up to the entity, any decisions made should be reasoned and documented.

Decisions on risks should take account of the wider context of the risk and include consideration of  the  requirements  of  other  parties,  such  as  sector,  regional  or  national  initiatives.  In  some circumstances, the risk evaluation can lead to a decision to undertake further analysis.

| SUB-CONTROL | 1) The entity shall consider the following risk treatment options and select one or more of them for each of the risks that have been assessed: • Risk Reduction - Reducing the risk by applying security controls • Risk Retention - Accepting the risk based on the entity's risk accepting criteria established on the information management risk policy (See M2.1.1) • Risk Avoidance - Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk • Risk Transfer - Transferring the risk to another party 2) The entity shall assess the risk treatment chosen to ensure that the selection of risk treatment options is successful by: • Deciding whether residual risk levels are tolerable • If not tolerable, generating a newrisk treatment • Assessing the effectiveness of that treatment (see also M2.3) |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Selecting the most appropriate information security risk treatment option involves balancing the costs and efforts of implementation against the benefits derived, with regard to sector, national or regulatory requirements. Decisions should also take into account risks which can warrant risk treatment that is not justifiable on economic grounds, e.g. severe (high negative consequence- but rare (low likelihood- risks.

A number of treatment options can and should be considered and applied either individually or  in  combination.  When  selecting  risk  treatment  options,  the  entity  should  consider  the expectations of the sector and national level.  Though equally effective, some risk treatments can be more acceptable to some stakeholders than to others.

The selected  risk  treatment  options  should  be  documented  in  the  risk  treatment  plan.  The treatment plan should clearly identify the priority order in which individual risk treatments should be implemented.

Risk treatment itself can introduce risks. A significant risk can be the failure or ineffectiveness of the risk treatment measures. Monitoring needs to be an integral part of the risk treatment plan to give assurance that the measures remain effective (see also M6).

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Controls  should  be  identified  to  manage  the  risks,  based  on  the  identified  risk  treatment option(s).  It is important to specify the relation between the risks and the identified controls, this relation is important for the ongoing risk management and should be documented in the risk treatment plan.

The first basis of control identification should be this Standard, which suggests a set of 'riskbased  applicable'  controls  that  addresses  a  lot  of  the  common  information  security  risks. Sector-specific controls should be identified to support the specific needs of the entity within its sector.

The  entity  should  also  identify  controls  that  are  required  for  risk  management  and  not documented in this Standard.  It is likely that such controls exist as an entity has risks specific to its business and its way to operate, and the identification of additional controls completes the controls for information security risk management.

The entity should compile a list of controls which have been identified to produce a Statement of  Applicability  (refer  to  M2.3.4).  It  might  be  that  the  Statement  of  Applicability  (refer  to Implementation Guidance of M2.3.4) leads to a revision of the identified controls.  This is the intention of producing the Statement of Applicability, it is supposed to act as a safety net that ensures that no impotent control has been overlooked.

It is important to be aware of that the list of identified controls is very likely to contain sensitive information. Therefore, appropriate care should be taken when making the summary of controls available to both internal and external recipients.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The purpose of risk treatment plans is to document how the chosen risk treatment options will be implemented. The information provided in treatment plans should include:

- A. The reasons for selection of treatment options
- B. The controls that have been identified to implement the selected risk treatment option(s)
- C. The identified risk reduction or other modification that is intended to be achieved by the identified control(s), also called residual risk
- D. Those who are accountable for approving the plan
- E. Those responsible for implementing controls and the overall plan
- F. Proposed actions to achieve this implementation
- G. Priorities of implementation
- H. Resource requirements including contingencies
- I. Target dates for control implementation
- J. Interdependencies of control implementation (when the implementation of a control requires the complete implementation of another control)
- K. Performance measures and constraints (which can also be documented elsewhere); and
- L. Reporting and monitoring requirements

The risk treatment plan should be integrated with the management processes of the entity and discussed with appropriate stakeholders.

Management should be aware of the nature and extent of the residual risk after risk treatment and should accept the residual risks. The residual risk should be documented and subjected to monitoring, review and, where appropriate, further treatment.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall produce and document a Statement of Applicability that contains: 1) The controls that have been identified as necessary 2) Reasons for identification of these controls 3) Their current status of implementation |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The  Statement  of  Applicability  should  be  produced  to  ensure  that  no  control  from  these Standards that is required by the entity for risk treatment is overlooked.

If the first version of the Statement of Applicability identifies controls from this Standard whose exclusion cannot be justified, the entity should go back to the control identification process (refer  to  M2.3.2)  and  check  whether  there  are  risks  whose  treatment  could  benefit  from this control.  If this is the case, the control under consideration should be included in the risk treatment.  If this is not the case, the entity should go back to the risk identification and ensure that all important risks have been identified.

The reasons for  the  identification  of  controls  is  needed  to  form  the  link  between  risks  and controls - this relationship can also be documented in the risk treatment plan (refer to M2.3.3). The Statement of Applicability can be a separate document, or can be combined with the risk treatment plan, this can be decided by the entity.

Based on the business objectives for information security and the results of the information security risk assessment and risk treatment process, information security objectives should be identified. The entity can consider high level objectives, such as:

- A. Maintaining the confidentially of sensitive entity information
- B. Successful management of the information security risks
- C. Efficient management of information security in the entity
- D. Compliance with sector or national requirements

These high level information security objectives are often directly derived from the business objectives,  and  other,  lower  level  objectives,  can  be  identified  to  support  their  fulfillment. The lower level information security objectives can be identified based on the results of the information security risk assessment and risk treatment process, and can also be identified by considering the following questions:

- A. What third party relationships and agreements exist, and what are associated information security requirements?
- B. Are there any services that have been outsourced?
- C. What kind of protection is needed, and against what threats?
- D. What are the distinct categories of information that require protection?
- E. What are the distinct types of information activities that need to be protected?
- F. What are the minimum market requirements for information security?
- G. What additional information security controls should provide a competitive advantage for the entity?
- H. What are the critical business processes, and how long can the entity tolerate interruptions to each critical business process?

When  planning  how  to  achieve  the  information  security  objectives,  it  can  be  helpful  to develop an equivalent of the risk treatment plan, i.e. a plan that details the actions, resources, responsibilities, time frames  and  methods  of  evaluating whether  the objectives have been achieved.

When planning how to achieve its information security objectives, the entity shall determine:

- A. What will be done
- B. What resources will be required
- C. Who will be responsible
- D. When it will be completed
- E. How the results will be evaluated

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Monitoring and review should be a planned part of the information security risk management process and involve regular checking, surveillance and updates.  The monitoring should be an ongoing process, which identifies any changes that are relevant to information security risk management, and there should also be planned processes that ensure that risk assessment and treatment updates are taking place.

Responsibilities  for  monitoring  and  review  should  be  clearly  defined.  (Refer  to  NCRMF  for further details)

The entity's monitoring and review processes should encompass all aspects of the information security risk management process for the purposes of:

- A. Ensuring that controls are effective in the risk management they are achieving
- B. Integrating new information to improve the risk assessment and/or treatment
- C. Analyzing  and  learning  lessons  from  events  (including  near-misses),  changes,  trends, successes and failures;
- D. Detecting changes in the external and internal context, including changes to risk criteria and the risk itself, which can require revision of risk treatments and priorities
- E. Vulnerability Assessment should be conducted frequently even after implementing security controls to identify emerging risks, new threats, trends, etc.

Progress in implementing risk treatment plans provides a performance indicator in itself. The results can be incorporated into the entity's overall performance management, measurement and external and internal reporting activities.

The results of monitoring and review should be recorded and externally and internally reported as appropriate, and should also be used as an input to the review of the information security risk management policy (refer to M2.1.1).

Communication and consultation with key stakeholders should take place during all stages of the risk management process. Therefore, plans for communication and consultation should be developed at an early stage. These should address issues relating to the risk itself, its causes, its consequences (if known), and the measures being taken to treat it. Effective external and internal  communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required.

Critical entities shall also take into account NESA's national awareness and capability building issuances, guidance, and activities.

The  entity  should  develop  a  program  that  ensures  continued  adequate  awareness  and competence for all persons doing work under the control of the entity.  This does include not only entity personnel but also any outsiders with access to information. Please note that the implementation of the awareness and training program might not be carried out by the entity and can, for example, be ensured contractually.

The first step in the program is the evaluation of the competencies required for the job function. The  Information  Security  Manager,  for  example,  should  have  a  good  understanding  of  the controls contained in this standard, and should know how to implement them and to maintain them effectively.

The entity should ensure that trainings take place as planned, and are not pushed off, e.g. due to work overload.  If such problems recur, it might be a sign for inadequate resourcing.  If trainings continue not to take place in the time frame planned, it is a non-conformity to sub-control 2mentioned above.

The awareness and training program should ensure that records of all trainings are generated. These  records  should  regularly  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  all  personnel  have  received  the training that they require.

Whatever training is conducted, it is important that the effectiveness of this training is assessed. An  easy  way  of  such  as  assessment  is  to  select  trainings  that  include  an  exam  at  the  end. Whenever this is not possible, interviews of feedback form should be used that provide enough information to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the training.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Through awareness campaigns, the entity promotes a culture of security. Security awareness programs  typically  focus  on  broad  topics,  such  as  security  threats  that  could  be  mitigated through good practice, the choice and usage of passwords, good practice for using a personal computer, sharing of account information, report incidents.

Entities  determine  the  appropriate  content  of  security  awareness  based  on  the  specific organizational requirements and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. Specific training methods may include:

- A. Mandatory annual awareness training
- B. Targeted, role-based training
- C. Internal security awareness websites
- D. Manuals, guides, and handbooks
- E. Seminars and slide presentations
- F. Events (e.g., security awareness week or month)
- G. Posters and brochures
- H. Email messages to all employees and contractors

Security awareness techniques can include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies  inscribed  with  security  reminders,  generating  email  advisories/notices  from  senior organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting information security awareness events.

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

The  human  resources  security  policy  facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  associated controls along the entire employment lifecycle: prior to employment, during employment, and termination or change of employment. The policy can, for example, contain:

- A. Scope of the policy
- B. Management roles and responsibilities during each phase of the employment lifecycle
- C. Employment terms and conditions
- D. Required information security awareness and training during employment in line with M3.1.1
- E. Employment termination procedures and checks

The human resources policy can be included as part of the general information security policy, in a single policy document, or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain entities.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Verification checks should take into account all relevant privacy, protection of personal data and/or employment based legislation, and should, where permitted, include the following:

- A. Availability of satisfactory character references, e.g. one business and one personal
- B. A check (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant's curriculum vitae
- C. Confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications
- D. Independent identity check (passport or similar document)
- E. More detailed checks, such as credit checks or checks of criminal records

Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves the person having access to information systems, and in particular if these are handling sensitive information, e.g. financial information  or  highly  confidential  information,  the  entity  should  also  consider  further,  more detailed checks.

Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification checks, e.g. who is eligible to screen people, and how, when and why verification checks are carried out.

A screening process should also be carried out for contractors, and third party users. Where contractors are provided through an agency the contract with the agency should clearly specify the agency's responsibilities for screening and the notification procedures they need to follow if screening has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern. In the same way, the agreement with the third party should clearly specify all responsibilities and notification procedures for screening.

Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the entity should be collected and handled in accordance with any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant jurisdiction.

The disciplinary process should not be commenced without prior verification that a security breach has occurred.

The formal disciplinary process should ensure correct and fair treatment for employees who are suspected of committing breaches of security. The formal disciplinary process should provide for a graduated response that takes into consideration factors such as the nature and gravity of the breach and its impact on business, whether or not this is a first or repeat offence, whether or not the violator was properly trained, relevant legislation, business contracts and other factors as  required.  In  serious  cases  of  misconduct  the  process  should  allow  for  instant  removal  of duties, access rights and privileges, and for immediate escorting out of the site, if necessary

The  termination  process  should  be  formalized  to  include  the  return  of  all  previously  issued software, corporate documents, and equipment. Other organizational assets such as mobile computing devices, credit cards, access cards, software, manuals, and information stored on electronic media also need to be returned.

In cases where an employee, contractor or third party user purchases the entity's equipment or uses their own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant information is transferred to the entity and securely erased from the equipment.

In  cases where an employee, contractor or third party user has knowledge that is important to ongoing operations, that information should be documented and transferred to the entity.

Upon  termination,  the  access  rights  of  an  individual  to  assets  associated  with  information systems and services should be reconsidered. This will determine whether it is necessary to remove access rights. Changes of an employment should be reflected in removal of all access rights  that  were  not  approved  for  the  new  employment.  The  access  rights  that  should  be removed or adapted include physical and logical access, keys, identification cards, information systems, subscriptions, and removal from any documentation that identifies them as a current member  of  the  entity.  If  a  departing  employee,  contractor  or  third  party  user  has  known passwords for accounts remaining active, these should be changed upon termination or change of employment, contract or agreement.

Access rights for information assets and information systems should be reduced or removed before the employment terminates or changes, depending on the evaluation of risk factors such as:

- A. Whether the termination or change is initiated by the employee, contractor or third party user, or by management and the reason of termination
- B. The current responsibilities of the employee, contractor or any other user
- C. The value of the assets currently accessible

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The  compliance  policy  facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  associated  controls  to  ensure the entity is compliant at the entity, sector, and national levels.  The policy includes applicable requirements, such as:

- A. Information security legal requirements
- B. Technical requirements
- C. Non-technical requirements

In addition, the compliance policy typically outlines the considerations for information systems audit. The compliance policy can be included as part of the general information security policy, in a single policy document, or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain entities.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Define a process for identifying records with specific compliance requirements regarding loss, destruction, falsification, or other applicable characteristics 2) Determine specific system requirements resulting from the identified requirements 3) Define specific controls to ensure all record protection |

Records should be categorized into record types, e.g. accounting records, database records, transaction logs, audit logs, and operational procedures, each with details of retention periods and type of storage media. Any related cryptographic keying material and programs associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures, should also be stored to enable decryption of the records for the length of time the records are retained.

Consideration  should  be  given  to  the  possibility  of  deterioration  of  media  used  for  storage of  records.  Storage  and  handling  procedures  should  be  implemented  in  accordance  with manufacturer's  recommendations.  For  long  term  storage,  the  use  of  paper  and  microfiche should  be  considered.  Where  electronic  storage  media  are  chosen,  procedures  to  ensure the ability to access data (both media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be included, to safeguard against loss due to future technology change.

Data  storage  systems  should  be  chosen  such  that  required  data  can  be  retrieved  in  an acceptable timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.

The system of storage and handling should ensure clear identification of records and of their retention period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This system  should  permit  appropriate  destruction  of  records  after  that  period  if  they  are  not needed by the entity.

To  meet  these  record  safeguarding  objectives,  the  following  steps  should  be  taken  within an entity:

- A. Guidelines should be issued on the retention, storage, handling, and disposal of records and information
- B. A  retention  schedule  should  be  drawn  up  identifying  records  and  the  period  of  time  for which they should be retained
- C. An inventory of sources of key information should be maintained
- D. Appropriate controls should be implemented to protect records and information from loss, destruction, and falsification

An organizational data protection and privacy policy should be developed and implemented. This policy should be communicated to all persons involved in the processing of personal information.

Compliance  with  this  policy  and  all  relevant  data  protection  legislation  and  regulations requires  appropriate  management structure  and  control.  Often  this  is  best  achieved  by  the appointment of a person responsible, such as a data protection officer, who should provide guidance to managers, users, and service providers on their individual responsibilities and the specific procedures that should be followed. Responsibility for handling personal information and ensuring awareness of the data protection principles should be dealt with in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information should be implemented

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Management should approve the use of information systems. Any use of these facilities for non-business  purposes  without  management  approval,  or  for  any  unauthorized  purposes, should be regarded as improper use of the information systems. If any unauthorized activity is identified by monitoring or other means, this activity should be brought to the attention of the individual manager concerned for consideration of appropriate disciplinary and/or legal action.

Legal advice should be taken before implementing monitoring procedures. All users should be aware of the precise scope of their permitted access and of the monitoring in place to detect unauthorized use. This can be achieved by giving users written authorization, a copy of which should  be  signed  by  the  user  and  securely  retained  by  the  entity.  Employees  of  an  entity, contractors, and third party users should be advised that no access will be permitted except that which is authorized.

At log-on, a warning message should be presented to indicate that the information systems being entered are owned by the entity and that unauthorized access is not permitted. The user has to acknowledge and react appropriately to the message on the screen to continue with the log-on process.

## APPLICABILITY

BASED ON RISK

ASSESSMENT

The entity shall ensure that information systems are regularly checked for compliance with the UAE IA Standards.

The entity shall:

- 1) Define and execute a process for routinely checking for technical compliance with security standards
- 2) Ensure results of compliance checking is performed by, and the results are reviewed by, authorized personnel with adequate technical capabilities
- 3) Report any issues detected during technical compliance checking to the appropriate authority for remediation

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

Technical compliance checking should be performed either manually (supported by appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer, and/or with the assistance of automated tools, which generate a technical report for subsequent interpretation by a technical specialist.

If penetration tests or vulnerability assessments are used, caution should be exercised as such activities could lead to a compromise of the security of the system. Such tests should be planned, documented and repeatable.

Any technical compliance check should only be carried out by competent, authorized persons, or under the supervision of such persons.

Ongoing performance monitoring and evaluation is one of the major contributors to overall effective and success information security operation within any entity.  Therefore, the entity should have an overall framework for its monitoring and performance measurement activities. These activities can have several sources of input:

- A. High level performance evaluation activities, such as the performance indictors suggested for sub-families in this Standard
- B. Detailed performance evaluation activities, such as the performance indictors suggested for 'risk-based applicable' controls
- C. Ongoing monitoring, which detects deviations and necessary corrections
- D. Incident reports, which indicate that one or more of the controls are not working as intended

The performance evaluation policy should define how these different performance indicators are integrated within the entity to provide an overall picture of information security performance to  management, and how the results of these performance measurement activities can be presented to management for decision-making.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The continual improvement the entity needs to apply to its information security controls (see also M6.3.2) needs to make use of the monitoring and performance measurement results to identify  which  areas  do  require  improvement.  Therefore,  these  activities  are  key  to  keeping information security up to date, and fit for purpose of the entity's requirements.

The results of monitoring and review should be recorded and externally and internally reported as appropriate, and should also be used as an input to the review of the information security risk management policy (refer to M2.1.1).

The entity should develop a plan to execute the monitoring and performance measurement activities, including all of the topics mentioned in the sub-controls above. It can be helpful to have clear responsibilities and schedule to carry out the monitoring and measuring, and there should be an independent review function that ensures that this monitoring takes place.

In addition to executing the monitoring and measurement activities, there is also a need to keep these activities up to date and effective, so all monitoring and performance evaluation activities should be subject periodical reviews, as well as immediate updates if the situation requires that.

The results of the monitoring and performance evaluation activities should be put into context with respect to:

- A. The information security policy (refer to M1.2.1)
- B. The information security risk management policy (refer to M2.1.1)
- C. Management  expectations  with  regards  to  information  security  and  the  overall  internal context (refer to M1.1.1)
- D. external requirements for information security, e.g. by the sector, regional or national

The  methods  selected  for  the  monitoring  and  performance  measurement  should  produce consistent and comparable results to assist the entity in measuring performance over time.

The entity's own requirements for information security B. The requirements of this Standard C. Any applicable requirements from the entity's sector, national or regulatory environment |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

Internal audits are another important means, in addition to the performance measurements, to assess compliance with the 'always applicable' controls of this Standard, the entity's own policies and procedures, and the applicable requirements from the entity's sector, national or regulatory environment.

The  information  security  controls  in  place  at  the  entity  should  be  subject  to  independent internal audits at a pre-defined schedule.  This type of auditing should not come as a surprise but should be planned in advance, and the auditor should provide an audit plan of the areas to be audited and people to be met, to ensure the audit does not disrupt the business processes more than necessary (see also the sub-controls above).

One of the important concepts of internal audits is the independence of the internal auditor(s) carrying out the audits.  If the necessary independence or expertise cannot be found within the entity, external resources can provide this service.  If the entity uses external resources, care should be taken to ensure that the external resource have enough knowledge of the entity to successfully conduct the audit.

Another important aspect of the internal audit is the entity's reaction to its results.  The results of  the  internal  audits  should be considered by the Information Security Committee (refer to M1.1.2), and it should be ensured that all findings of the audit are corrected in a timely manner.

## APPLICABILITY

ALWAYS APPLICABLE

The entity shall correct any nonconformity with these Standards..

The  entity  shall  react  to  the  nonconformity  when  it  occurs,  and  take action to control and correct it, and to deal with the consequences. The entity shall:

- 1) Evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of nonconformities, in order that it does not recur or occur elsewhere, by:
- A.  Reviewing the nonconformity
- B.  Determining the causes of the nonconformity
- C.  Determining if similar nonconformities exist, or could potentially occur
- 2) Implement  the  appropriate  action  needed  to  the  effects  of  the encountered nonconformities
- 3) Review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken
- 4) Document the corrective actions taken against the nonconformities

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The entity should have a clear action plan that describes how identified non-conformities will be addressed.  This can take place in the Information Security Committee (refer to M1.1.2) and should  be  initiated  and  controlled  by  the  Information  Security  Manager.  Determine  whether corrective action is justified on the basis of evaluating the following considerations:

- A. Whether it is a first or a repeat occurrence
- B. Frequency and history of occurrences (repeated occurrences)
- C. Seriousness of the impact
- D. Root cause for the non-conformity for which the following activities have to be performed -
- Collect data
- Get expert advice
- Consult with vendors, partners and associates

The corrective action(s) identified should be implemented within an appropriate timeframe and prioritized based on the risk treatment plan (see M2); delays should be avoided to reduce the negative effects of non-conformities to the information security in place at the entity. It is also important to ensure that the implemented corrective actions achieve their intended objective and are effective. The review of the effectiveness of corrective actions can be done by the Information Security Committee, and the results should be documented.

The  asset  management  policy  provides  a  structure  for  the  management  of  IT  assets  (e.g. people, hardware, software, data, facilities) from procurement to disposal.  The policy can, for example, contain in addition to the required sub-controls:

- A. IT Assets classification scheme
- B. Classified assets security requirements
- C. Disciplinary procedure

| CONTROL     | The entity shall develop a classification scheme for its information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| SUB-CONTROL | The classification shall include: 1) Aninformation classification scheme based on information value, legal requirements, sensitivity, and criticality to the entity 2) The degree of protection required for each category The information classification scheme shall ensure: 3) Information classification based on the established levels and mapped to accountable owners 4) Anup-to-date information classification in accordance with changes of their value, sensitivity and criticality through their life-cycle 5) The possibility to be accessed by automated systems to enforce specific protections based on the classification level 6) Sufficient information regarding physical assets (locations, data centers, networks, systems, storage, etc.) used to store, process or transmit information assets is provided |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

Classifications  and  associated  protective  controls  for  information  should  take  account  of business  needs  for  sharing  or  restricting  information,  as  well  as  legal  requirements.  Assets other than information can also be classified in conformance with classification of information which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset.

Classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the classification over time; in accordance with some predetermined access control policy. The level of protection in the scheme should be assessed by analyzing confidentiality, integrity and availability and any other requirements for the information considered.

Owners  of  information  assets  should  be  accountable  for  their  classification.  The  scheme should  be  consistent  across  the  whole  entity  so  that  everyone  will  classify  information  and related  assets  in  the  same  way,  have  a  common  understanding  of  protection  requirements and apply the appropriate protection. Each level should be given a name that makes sense in the context of the classification scheme's application. Classification should be included in the entity's  processes,  and  consistent  and  coherent  across  the  entity.  Results  of  classification should indicate value of assets depending on their sensitivity and criticality to the entity, e.g. in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of their value, sensitivity and criticality through their life-cycle.

Classification provides people who deal with information a concise indication of how to handle and  protect  it.  Creating  groups  of  information  with  similar  protection  needs  and  specifying information security procedures that apply to all the information in the group facilitate this. This approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls.

An example of information confidentiality classification scheme could be based on four levels as follows:

- A) Disclosure causes no harm
- B) Disclosure causes minor embarrassment or minor operational inconvenience
- C) Disclosure has a significant short term impact on operations or tactical objectives
- D) Disclosure has a serious impact on long term strategic objectives or put the survival of the organization at risk

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Establish a procedure for labeling of information and its related assets in physical or electronic formats to reflect their attributed classification 2) Apply the appropriate label on information |

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Procedures for information labeling need to cover information and its related assets in physical and electronic formats. The labeling should reflect the classification scheme established in. The labels should be easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance where and how labels are  attached in  consideration of how the information is accessed or the assets are handled depending on the types of media. The procedures can define cases where labeling is omitted, e.g. labeling of non-confidential information to reduce workloads. Employees and external party users should be made aware of labeling procedures.

Output  from  systems  containing  information  that  is  classified  as  being  sensitive  or  critical should carry an appropriate classification label in the output.

The entity shall handle assets in accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the entity.

SUB-CONTROL

The entity shall:

- 1) Develop handling procedures for processing, storing and communicating information consistent with its classification and its attached label

- 2) Safeguard the information in accordance with the established procedures

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

Procedures  should  be  drawn  up  for  handling,  processing,  storing  and  communicating information consistent with its classification. The following items should be considered.

- A. Handling of all media to its indicated classification level of the information stored on it
- B. Access restrictions to prevent access from unauthorized personnel
- C. Maintenance of a formal record of the authorized recipients of assets
- D. Protection  of  temporary  or  permanent  copies  of  information  to  a  level  consistent with  the  protection  of  the  original  information;  storage  of  IT  assets  in  accordance  with manufacturers' specifications
- E. Keeping the distribution of assets to a minimum required to support the entity's needs
- F. Clear marking of all copies of media for the attention of the authorized recipient

The classification scheme used within the entity may not be equivalent to the schemes used by  other  entities,  even  if  the  names  for  levels  are  similar;  in  addition,  information  moving between entities may vary in classification depending on its context in each entity, even if their classification schemes are identical.

Agreements  with  other  entities  that  include  information  sharing  should  include  procedures to identify the classification of that information and to interpret the classification labels from other entities.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Establish media management procedures along its lifecycle (setup, distribution, utilization and disposal) 2) Identify the needed protection levels in accordance with the classification scheme |

Removable media such as optical discs (Blu-ray discs, DVDs, CDs), memory cards (CompactFlash card, Secure Digital card, Memory Stick), floppy disks / zip disks, disk packs, and magnetic tapes, are typically found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices.

The following guidelines for the management of removable media should be considered:

- A. If no longer required, the contents of any re-usable media that are to be removed from the entity should be made unrecoverable; data wiping software could be used for instance
- B. Where necessary and practical, authorization should be required for media removed from the entity and a record of such removals should be kept in order to maintain an audit trail
- C. All media should be stored in a safe, secure environment, in accordance with manufacturers' specifications
- D. If  data confidentiality or integrity are important considerations, cryptographic techniques should be used to protect data on removable media

- E. To mitigate the risk of media degrading while stored data are still needed, the data should be transferred to fresh media before it gets unreadable
- F. Multiple copies of valuable data should be stored on separate media to further reduce the risk of coincident data damage or loss
- G. Registration of removable media should be considered to limit the opportunity for data loss;
- H. Prevent content auto-run on laptops, workstations, and servers for removable media
- I. Removable media drives should only be enabled if there is a business reason for doing so

All procedures and authorization levels should be documented.

Formal procedures for the secure disposal of media should be established to minimize the risk of confidential information leakage to unauthorized persons. The procedures for secure disposal of  media containing confidential information should be corresponding with the sensitivity of that information.

The following items should be considered:

- A. Media containing confidential information should be stored and disposed of securely and safely,  e.g.  by  incineration  or  shredding,  or  erased  of  data  for  use  by  another  application within the entity
- B. Procedures should be in place to identify the items that might require secure disposal
- C. It  may be easier to arrange for all media items to be collected and disposed of securely, rather than attempting to separate out the sensitive items
- D. Many  entities  offer  collection  and  disposal  services  for  media;  care  should  be  taken  in selecting a suitable external party with adequate controls and experience
- E. Disposal  of  sensitive  items  should  be  logged  where  possible  in  order  to  maintain  an audit trail

When  accumulating  media  for  disposal,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  aggregation effect, which may cause a large quantity of non-confidential information to become sensitive.

| CONTROL     | The entity shall use security perimeters (barriers such as walls, card controlled entry gates or manned reception desks) to protect areas that contain information and information systems.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify and classify security areas based on the assets and information they process or contain 2) Define security perimeters for every classified security level to ensure the right level of protection is applied 3) Ensure the right security countermeasures are adopted to protect areas that contain information and information systems |

The following guidelines should be considered and implemented where appropriate for physical security perimeters:

- A. Security perimeters should be clearly defined, and the siting and strength of each of the perimeters should depend on the security requirements of the assets within the perimeter and the results of a risk assessment
- B. Perimeters of a building or site containing information systems should be physically sound (i.e. there should be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break-in could easily occur); the external walls of the site should be of solid construction and all external doors should be suitably protected against unauthorized access with control mechanisms, e.g. bars, alarms, locks etc.; doors and windows should be locked when unattended and external protection should be considered for windows, particularly at ground level
- C. A manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building should  be  in  place;  access  to  sites  and  buildings  should  be  restricted  to  authorized personnel only
- D. Physical barriers should, where applicable, be built to prevent unauthorized physical access and environmental contamination
- E. All fire doors on a security perimeter should be alarmed, monitored, and tested in conjunction with the walls to establish the required level of resistance in accordance to suitable regional, national, and international standards; they should operate in accordance with local fire code in a failsafe manner
- F. Suitable intruder detection systems should be installed to national, regional or international standards  and  regularly  tested  to  cover  all  external  doors  and  accessible  windows; unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover should also be provided for other areas, e.g. computer room or communications rooms
- G. Information  systems  managed  by  the  entity  should  be  physically  separated  from  those managed by third parties

| SUB-CONTROL | The Operations Management Policy shall: 1) Be appropriate to the purpose of the entity 2) Provide the framework for managing the operations of systems, processes, and controls related to information security |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The  operations  management  policy  defines  and  documents  operational  standards  and procedures across the IT lifecycle (planning, design, implementation, operations, and maintenance) necessary to maximize information security. The policy can, for example, contain:

- A. Scope of the policy
- B. Segregation of duties
- C. Configuration management
- D. Change request
- E. Quality management
- F. Backup procedures
- G. Monitoring procedures

The operations management policy can be included as part of the general information security policy,  in  a  single  policy  document,  or  can  be  represented  by  multiple  policies  reflecting  the complex nature of certain entities.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Documented procedures should be prepared for system activities associated with information processing  and  communication  systems,  such  as  computer  start-up  and  close-down procedures,  back-  up,  equipment  maintenance,  media  handling,  computer  room  and  mail handling management, and safety.

The operating procedures should specify the instructions for the detailed execution of each job including:

- A. Processing and handling of information
- B. Backup
- C. Scheduling requirements, including interdependencies with other systems, earliest job start and latest job completion times
- D. Instructions for handling errors or other exceptional conditions, which might arise during job execution, including restrictions on the use of system utilities
- E. Support contacts in the event of unexpected operational or technical difficulties
- F. Special output and media handling instructions, such as the use of special stationery or the management of confidential output including procedures for secure disposal of output from failed jobs
- G. System restart and recovery procedures for use in the event of system failure
- H. The management of audit-trail and system log information

Operating  procedures,  and  the  documented  procedures  for  system  activities,  should  be treated  as  formal  documents  and  changes  authorized  by  management.  Where  technically feasible,  information  systems  should  be  managed  consistently,  using  the  same  procedures, tools, and utilities

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Operational systems and application software should be subject to strict change management control. In particular, the following items should be considered:

- A. Identification and recording of significant changes
- B. Planning and testing of changes
- C. Assessment of the potential impacts, including security impacts, of such changes
- D. Formal approval procedure for proposed changes
- E. Communication of change details to all relevant persons
- F. Fallback procedures, including procedures and responsibilities for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes and unforeseen events

Formal management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all changes to equipment, software or procedures. When changes are made, an audit log containing all relevant information should be retained.

| SUB-CONTROL | TThe entity shall: 1) Identify specific sets of duties that should be segregated 2) Ensure duties with segregation requirements are assigned to different resources 3) Implement suitable alternative controls in the case that duties with segregation requirements cannot be assigned to different resources |

Segregation  of  duties  is  a  method  for  reducing  the  risk  of  accidental  or  deliberate  system misuse. Care should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without authorization or detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its authorization. The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the controls.

Small entities may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered. It is important that security audit remains independent.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Have the ability to measure capacity of current systems and estimate capacity requirements of planned systems 2) Integrate capacity management controls into relevant demand management and software / system development lifecycle |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

For each new and ongoing activity, capacity requirements should be identified. System tuning and  monitoring  should  be  applied  to  ensure  and,  where  necessary,  improve  the  availability and efficiency of systems. Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of future capacity requirements should take account of new business and  system  requirements  and  current  and  projected  trends  in  the  entity's  information processing capabilities.

Particular  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  any  resources  with  long  procurement  lead  times  or high costs; therefore managers should monitor the utilization of key system resources. They should identify trends in usage, particularly in relation to business applications or management information system tools.

Managers  should  use  this  information  to  identify  and  avoid  potential  bottlenecks  and dependence on key personnel that might present a threat to system security or services, and plan appropriate action.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Define the requirements for testing new/updated systems prior to placing them in the operational environment 2) Define the acceptable parameters for each requirement 3) Ensure tests are carried out and that results are documented 4) Formally assign responsibility for ensuring tests are completed prior to accepting new systems into operational environment |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

Managers should ensure that the requirements and criteria for acceptance of new systems are clearly defined, agreed, documented, and tested. New information systems, upgrades, and new versions should only be migrated into production after obtaining formal acceptance. The following items should be considered prior to formal acceptance being provided:

- A. Performance and computer capacity requirements
- B. Error recovery and restart procedures, and contingency plans
- C. Preparation and testing of routine operating procedures to defined standards;
- D. Agreed set of security controls in place
- E. Effective manual procedures
- F. Business continuity arrangements
- G. Evidence  that  installation  of  the  new  system  will  not  adversely  affect  existing  systems, particularly at peak processing times, such as month end
- H. Evidence that consideration has been given to the effect the new system has on the overall security of the entity
- I. Training in the operation or use of new systems
- L. Ease of use, as this affects user performance and avoids human error

For  major  new  developments,  the  operations  function  and  users  should  be  consulted  at  all stages  in  the  development  process  to  ensure  the  operational  efficiency  of  the  proposed system design. Appropriate tests should be carried out to confirm that all acceptance criteria have been fully satisfied.

| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | Relying on policy and user action to keep anti-malware tools up to date has been widely discredited, as many users have not proven capable of consistently handling this task. To ensure anti-virus signatures are up to date, entities use automation. They use the built-in administrative features of enterprise endpoint security suites to verify that anti-virus, anti-spyware, and host-based IDS featuresareactiveoneverymanagedsystem.Theyrun automated assessments daily and review the results to find and mitigate systems that have deactivated such protections, as well as systems that do not have the latest malware definitions. Some entities deploy free or commercial honeypot and tarpit tools to identify attackers in their environment. Security personnel should continuously monitor honeypots and tarpits to determine whether traffic is directed to them and account logins are attempted. When they identify such events, these personnel should gather the source address from which this traffic originates and other details associated with the attack for follow-on investigation. |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Malware includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malware can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography.

Protection against malware should be based on malware detection and repair software, security awareness, and appropriate system access and change management controls. The following guidance should be considered:

- A. Establishing a formal policy prohibiting the use of unauthorized software;
- B. Establishing  a  formal  policy  to  protect  against  risks  associated  with  obtaining  files  and software  either  from  or  via  external  networks,  or  on  any  other  medium,  indicating  what protective measures should be taken;
- C. Conducting regular reviews of the software and data content of systems supporting critical business processes; the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments should be formally investigated;
- D. Installation  and  regular  update  of  software  that  detects  and  eradicate  malware  to  scan computers and media as a precautionary control, or on a routine basis; the checks carried out should include:
- Reviewing any files received over networks or via any form of storage medium, for malware before use;
- reviewing electronic mail attachments and downloads for malware before use; this check should be carried out at different places, e.g. at electronic mail servers, desk top computers and when entering the network of the entity;
- Checking web pages for malware;
- E. Defining management procedures and responsibilities to deal with malware protection on systems, training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks;
- F. Preparing appropriate business continuity plans (refer to T9.2.2) for recovering from malware attacks, including all necessary data and software backup and recovery arrangements;
- G. Implementing procedures to regularly collect information, such as subscribing to mailing lists and/or checking web sites giving information about new malware;
- H. Implementing procedures to verify information relating to malware, and ensure that warning bulletins are accurate and informative; managers should ensure that qualified sources, e.g. reputable journals, reliable Internet sites or suppliers producing software protecting against malware, are used to differentiate between hoaxes and real malware; all users should be made aware of the problem of hoaxes and what to do on receipt of them;
- I. Isolate environments where catastrophic impacts may result.

## Additional measures can include:

- Monitor  workstations,  servers,  and  mobile  devices  for  active,  up-to-date  anti-malware protection with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality · Prevent content auto-run on laptops, workstations, and servers
- Scan information systems periodically and files coming from external sources (including email attachments) in real-time
- Periodically update the protection mechanism

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Establish guidelines for determining what information and software requires backup and how often 2) Establish and document clear backup procedures and system capabilities for all applicable backup requirements 3) Ensure backed up information and software is routinely tested for reliability |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Adequate backup systems should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure.

The following items for information backup should be considered:

- A. The necessary level of backup information should be defined;
- B. Accurate  and  complete  records  of  the  backup  copies  and  documented  restoration procedures should be produced;
- C. The extent  (e.g.  full  or  differential  backup)  and  frequency  of  backups  should  reflect  the business requirements of the entity, the security requirements of the information involved, and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the entity;
- D. Backups  should  be  stored  in  a  remote  location,  at  a  sufficient  distance  to  escape  any damage from a disaster at the main site;
- E. Backup  information  should  be  given  an  appropriate  level  of  physical  and  environmental protection consistent with these Standards applied at the main site; the controls applied to media at the main site should be extended to cover the backup site;
- F. Backup  media  should  be  regularly  tested  to  ensure  that  they  can  be  relied  upon  for emergency use when necessary;
- G. Restoration  procedures  should  be  regularly  checked  and  tested  to  ensure  that  they are  effective  and  that  they  can  be  completed  within  the  time  allotted  in  the  operational procedures for recovery;
- H. In situations where confidentiality is of importance, backups should be protected by means of encryption.

Backup  arrangements  for  individual  systems  should  be  regularly  tested  to  ensure  that  they meet the requirements of business continuity plans (refer to T9.2.2). For critical systems, the backup arrangements should cover all systems information, applications, and data necessary to recover the complete system in the event of a disaster.

The retention period for essential business information, and also any requirement for archive copies to be permanently retained should be determined.

Once per quarter (or whenever new backup equipment is purchased), a testing team should evaluate a random sample of system backups by attempting to restore them on a test bed environment. The restored systems should be verified to ensure that the operating system, application, and data from the backup are all intact and functional.

| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | Most free and commercial operating systems, network services, and firewall technologies offer logging capabilities. Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators. Even with automated log analysis tools, human expertise and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks. |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The entity should define events that need to be captured, the frequency of audit log reviews, and retention requirements for audit logs. Monitoring procedures should be developed, detailing the steps of the monitoring, the response actions and how the monitoring process feeds into the  incident  response  process.  Clear  responsibilities  should  be  assigned  for  the  personnel performing monitoring. Each addition/change of systems in the facility should be considered for the amendment of the monitoring policy and procedures, to ensure they properly cover the updated environment.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The  level  of  monitoring  required  for  individual  systems  should  be  determined  by  a  risk assessment.  An  entity  should  comply  with  all  relevant  legal  requirements  applicable  to  its monitoring activities. Areas that should be considered include:

- A. Authorized access, including detail such as:
2. 1-  The user ID
3. 2-  The date and time of key events
4. 3-  The types of events
5. 4-  The files accessed
6. 5-  The program/utilities used
- B. All privileged operations, such as
8. 1-  Use of privileged accounts, e.g. supervisor, root, administrator
9. 2-  System start-up and stop
10. 3-  I/O device attachment/detachment
11. 4-  Deleting, creating and granting privileges activities
- C. Unauthorized access attempts, such as:
13. 1-  Failed or rejected user actions
14. 2-  Failed or rejected actions involving data and other resources
15. 3-  Access policy violations and notifications for network gateways and firewalls
16. 4-  Alerts from proprietary intrusion detection systems
- D. System alerts or failures, such as:
18. 1-  Console alerts or messages
19. 2-  System log exceptions
20. 3-  Network management alarms
21. 4-  Alarms raised by the access control system
- E. Database activities, such as:
23. 1-  Use of privileged accounts
24. 2-  Backup / restore
25. 3-  Failed or rejected user actions
- F. Changes to, or attempts to change, system security settings and controls.

How often the results of monitoring activities are reviewed should depend on the risks involved. Risk factors that should be considered include the:

- A. Criticality of the application processes
- B. Value, sensitivity, and criticality of the information involved
- C. Past experience of system infiltration and misuse, and the frequency of vulnerabilities being exploited
- D. Extent of system interconnection (particularly public networks)
- E. Logging facility being de-activated

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Fault Logging enables systems to log and report faults (problems, errors or failures) related to information processing or communications. Faults reported by users or by system programs should be logged. There should be clear rules for handling reported faults including:

- A. Review of fault logs to ensure that faults have been satisfactorily resolved;
- B. Review of corrective measures to ensure that controls have not been compromised, and that the action taken is fully authorized.

It should be ensured that error logging is enabled, if this system function is available.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Where a computer or communications device has the capability to operate a real-time clock, this clock should be set to an agreed standard, e.g. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC- or local standard time. As some clocks are known to drift with time, there should be a procedure that checks for and corrects any significant variation.

The correct interpretation of the date/time format is important to ensure that the timestamp reflects the real date/time. Local specifics (e.g. daylight savings) should be taken into account.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Security considerations for electronic commerce should include the following:

- A. The  level of  confidence  each  party  requires  in  each  other's  claimed  identity,  e.g. through authentication
- B. Authorization processes associated with who may set prices, issue or sign key trading documents
- C. Ensuring that trading partners are fully informed of their authorizations
- D. Determining  and  meeting  requirements  for  confidentiality,  integrity,  proof  of  dispatch and receipt of key documents, and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with tendering and contract processes
- E. The level of trust required in the integrity of advertised price lists
- F. The confidentiality of any sensitive data or information
- G. The confidentiality and integrity of any order transactions, payment information, delivery address details, and confirmation of receipts
- H. The degree of verification appropriate to check payment information supplied by a customer
- I.      Selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment to guard against fraud

- J. The level of protection required to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of order information
- K. Avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;
- L. LIability associated with any fraudulent transactions;
- M. Insurance requirements.

Many of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptographic controls taking into account compliance with legal requirements.

Electronic  commerce  arrangements  between  trading  partners  should  be  supported  by  a documented agreement which commits both parties to the agreed terms of trading, including details of authorization (see b- above). Other agreements with information service and value added network providers may be necessary.

Public trading systems should publicize their terms of business to customers. Consideration should be given to the resilience to attack of the host(s) used for electronic commerce, and the security implications of any network interconnection required for the implementation of electronic commerce services.

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

Software, data, and other information requiring a high level of integrity, being made available on  a  publicly  available  system,  should  be  protected  by  appropriate  mechanisms,  e.g.  digital signatures. The publicly accessible system should be tested against weaknesses and failures prior to information being made available.

There  should  be  a  formal  approval  process  before  information  is  made  publicly  available.  In addition, all input provided from the outside to the system should be verified and approved.

Electronic  publishing  systems,  especially  those  that  permit  feedback  and  direct  entering  of information, should be carefully controlled so that:

- A. Information is obtained in compliance with any data protection legislation
- B. Information input to, and processed by, the publishing system will be processed completely and accurately in a timely manner
- C. Sensitive information will be protected during collection, processing, and storage
- D. Access to the publishing system does not allow unintended access to networks to which the system is connected

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard (also refer to National Cyber Information Sharing Policy).

While most information sharing communities are built on a voluntary basis, certain entities may also have mandatory requirements to join specific information sharing platforms (e.g. sector or national level platforms established by regulators or other national authorities).

In  all  cases,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  information  sharing  platform  manager  to  outline minimum security requirements for all information sharing community members.  This helps install  a  basic  component  of  trust  that  all  community  members  have  the  minimum  security controls in place to protect the information being shared on the platform.

Entities  looking  to  connect  to  information  sharing  platforms  should  contact  the  platform manager  for security requirements  and ensure all requirements  are fully  understood and implemented.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard (also refer to National Cyber Information Sharing Policy).

Based on urgency, potential consequences and technical constraints, it may not be possible for  an  entity  to  validate  all  information  before  transmission  into  the  information  sharing community. Where limitations exist, these should be indicated as part of the message. Also, indicating reservations on credibility of information is particularly important where the source is  anonymous or unknown. It is important to indicate where the originator has been able to validate the information given directly, and can vouch for its authenticity.

There are technical mechanisms that can be used to provide authenticity without compromising anonymity.  For  example,  shared  cryptographic  secrets  could  be  used  to  confirm  that  a communication  originated  from  a  member  of  the  community  without  revealing  the  actual identity of the originator.

Each  recipient  should  be  responsible  for  obtaining  any  necessary  authorizations  for  wider release from the originator prior to onwards distribution.

In inter-sector communications, the originator may not know who all the entities that receive the information will be. In such a case, a general or specific sector release approval will need to be granted.

In  addition,  all  information  sharing  communities  should  define  rules  for  the  protection  of information in transit, and only permit members to join the community if such rules are accepted and implemented by the prospective member. Any supporting entity should implement such rules internally.

Information sharing communities should consider implementing alternative mechanisms for information sharing that do not rely on electronic messaging, and enabling members to specify that specific messages are distributed by such other routes.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Network  managers  should  implement  controls  to  ensure  the  security  of  information  in networks, and the protection of connected services from unauthorized access. In particular, the following items should be considered:

- A. Operational  responsibility  for  networks  should  be  separated  from  computer  operations where appropriate
- B. Responsibilities  and  procedures  for  the  management  of  remote  equipment,  including equipment in user areas, should be established
- C. Special controls may be required to maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected
- D. Management  activities  should  be  closely  coordinated  both  to  optimize  the  service  to the  entity  and  to  ensure  that  controls  are  consistently  applied  across  the  information processing infrastructure

## Further measures can include:

- E. Implement  ingress  and  egress  filtering  to  allow  only  those  ports  and  protocols  with  an explicit and documented business need
- F. Restrict access only to trusted sites (white lists)
- G. Inspect packets on DMZ networks using Security Event Information Management (SEIM) or log analytics systems
- H. Deploy  Sender  Policy  Framework  (SPF)  records  in  DNS  and  enabling  receiver-side verification in mail servers
- I. Disable / uninstall unused services;
- J. Enable host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on end systems with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed

One method of controlling the security of large networks is to divide them into separate logical network  domains,  e.g.  an  entity's  internal  network  domains  and  external  network  domains, each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls can be applied in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, e.g.  publicly  accessible  systems,  internal  networks,  and  critical  assets.  The  domains  should be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.

Such  a  network  perimeter  can  be  implemented  by  installing  a  secure  gateway  between  the two networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two domains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block unauthorized access in accordance with the entity's access control policy. An example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user groups within the entity.

Networks  can  also  be  segregated  using  the  network  device  functionality,  e.g.  IP  switching. Separate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the routing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists.

The criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control policy and access requirements, and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology.

In  addition,  segregation  of  networks  should  be  based  on  the  value  and  classification  of information stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Consideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private networks. As the perimeters of wireless networks are not well defined, a risk assessment should be  carried  out  in  such  cases  to  identify  controls  (e.g.  strong  authentication,  cryptographic methods, and frequency selection) to maintain network segregation.

When designing its wireless networks, the entity should consider the number of base stations to be deployed, where they will be situated, what bandwidth limitations should apply to clients and what wired alternatives should exist, so as to limit the potential for wireless-based Denial of Service attacks.

The  use  of  'guest'  wireless  networks  should  be  restricted  to  genuine  short-term  guests  of the Entity and consultants without a verified need for connection to the Entity's core network. Guest networks should only connect to the Internet and their data should not transit via the Entity's core network.  Traffic on wireless guest networks should not be terminated on the core network and should be tunnelled directly to the network perimeter.

Traffic  on  guest  networks  should  be  monitored  by  the  entity  to  ensure  conformance  with its  acceptable  usage  provisions.    Temporary  users  of  guest  networks  should  be  required  to authenticate to the network, to avoid opportunistic use of the Entity's network resources.

Network managers should implement controls to ensure the security of information in wireless. In particular, special controls should be established to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over wireless networks, and to protect the connected systems and applications.

The  entity  should  prohibit  and  sanction  the  creation  and  use  of  ad-hoc  wireless  networks, including the connecting of unapproved wireless base-stations to the entity's core data network.

The entity should put in place mechanisms that allow for the identification and isolation of rogue wireless access points.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Asset owners should determine appropriate access rules, privileges and restrictions for specific user roles towards their assets, with the amount of detail and the strictness of the controls reflecting the associated information security risks.

Users and service providers should be given a clear statement of the business requirements to be met by access controls.

The policy should take account of the following:

- A. Security requirements of individual business applications
- B. Policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need to know principle and security levels and classification of information
- C. Consistency between the access rights and information classification policies of different systems and networks
- D. Relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding protection of access to data or services
- E. Management of access rights for users and mobile devices in a distributed and networked environment which recognizes all types of connections available
- F. Segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration
- G. Requirements for formal authorization of access requests
- H. Requirements for periodic review of access controls
- I. Removal of access rights related to users and mobile devices
- J. Archiving of records of all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities and security credentials
- K. Privileged access roles

When  using  mobile  devices,  e.g.  notebooks,  palmtops,  laptops,  smart  cards,  and  mobile phones, special care should be taken to ensure that business information is not compromised. The access control policy should take into account the risks of working with mobile computing equipment in unprotected environments.

The  mobile related requirements should include physical protection, access controls, cryptographic techniques, backups, and virus protection. This policy should also include rules and advice on connecting mobile devices to networks and guidance on the use of these facilities in public places.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Establish and formalize procedures for the registration and de- registration of users 2) Ensure that a separate account is created for each person requiring access, and prohibit sharing of same accounts across multiple users |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The access control procedure for user registration and de-registration should include:

- A. Using unique user IDs to enable users to be linked to and held responsible for their actions; the use of shared IDs should only be permitted where they are necessary for business or operational reasons and should be approved and documented
- B. Verifying  that  the  user  has  authorization  from  the  owner  of  the  information  system  or service for the use of the information system or service; separate approval for access rights from management may also be appropriate
- C. Verifying  that  the  level  of  access  granted  is  appropriate  to  the  business  purpose  and  is consistent  with  organizational  security  policy,  e.g.  it  does  not  compromise  segregation of duties
- D. Ensuring service providers do not provide access until authorization procedures have been completed
- E. Maintaining a formal record of all persons registered to use systems and service centrally
- F. Immediately removing or blocking access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs or left the entity
- G. Periodically identifying, and removing or blocking, redundant user IDs and redundant and inactive accounts
- H. Ensuring that redundant user IDs are not issued to other users

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Multi-user  systems  that  require  protection  against  unauthorized  access  should  have  the allocation of privileges controlled through a formal authorization process in accordance with the relevant access control policy. The following steps should be considered:

- A. Identify  privileged  access  rights  associated  with  each  system,  e.g.  operating  system, database and application
- B. Privileged access rights should:
-  Be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event basis in line with the  access  control  policy  ,  i.e.  the  minimum  requirement  for  their  functional  role  only when needed
-  Not be granted until the authorization process is complete
-  Be assigned to a different User ID than the User ID used for day to day work. Regular user activities should not be performed from privileged accounts
- C. An authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated should be maintained;
- D. Requirements for expiry of privileged access rights should be defined
- E. The competences of users with privileged access rights  should  be  reviewed  regularly  in order to verify if they are in line with their duties
- F. Specific  procedures  should  be  established  and  maintained  in  order  to  avoid  the  use  of generic administration User IDs, according to systems configuration capabilities
- G. For  generic  administration  User  IDs,  the  confidentiality  of  security  credentials  should be  maintained  when  shared  (changing  them  frequently  and  as  soon  as  possible  when  a privileged user leaves or changes job, communicating them among privileged users with appropriate mechanisms)

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

## The process should include the following requirements:

- A. Users  should  be  required  to  sign  a  statement  to  keep  personal  security  credentials confidential and to keep group e.g. security credentials solely within the members of the group; this signed statement could be included in the terms and conditions of employment
- B. When  users  are  required  to  maintain  their  own  security  credentials  they  should  be provided  initially  with  secure  temporary  security  credentials  ,  which  they  are  forced  to change immediately
- C. Establish procedures to verify the identity of a user prior to providing a new, replacement or temporary security credentials
- D. Temporary security credentials should be given to users in a secure manner; the use of external parties or unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages should be avoided
- E. Temporary  security  credentials should be unique to an individual and should not be guessable
- F. Users should acknowledge receipt of security credentials
- G. Default  vendor  security  credentials  should  be  altered  following  installation  of  systems or software.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The review of access rights should consider the following guidelines:

- A. Users' access rights should be reviewed at regular intervals and after any changes, such as promotion, demotion or termination of employment
- B. User access rights should be reviewed and re-allocated when moving from one employment to another within the same entity
- C. Authorizations for special privileged access rights should be reviewed at more frequent intervals
- D. Privilege  allocations  should  be  checked  at  regular  intervals  to  ensure  that  unauthorized privileges have not been obtained
- E. Changes to privileged accounts should be logged for periodic review

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Develop a good practice for use of security credentials 2) Share and educate users on the developed good practices through awareness and training sessions (refer to M3.2.1) |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

## All users should be advised to:

- A. Keep secret authentication confidential, ensuring that they are not divulged to any other parties, including people of authority;
- B. Avoid keeping a record (e.g. paper, software file or hand-held device- of security credentials, unless this can be stored securely and the method of storing has been approved (e.g. password vault);
- C. Change security credentials whenever there is any indication of their possible compromise;
- D. When passwords are used as security credentials, select quality passwords with sufficient minimum length which are:
- 1) Easy to remember
- 2) Not based on anything somebody else could easily guess or obtain using person related information, e.g. names, telephone numbers and dates of birth etc.;
- 3) Not vulnerable to dictionary attacks (i.e. do not consist of words included in dictionaries)
- 4) Free of consecutive identical, all-numeric or all-alphabetic characters
- E. Change temporary passwords at the first log-on
- F. Not share individual user's security credentials
- G. When passwords are used as security credentials in automated logon procedures, these should not be stored without proper protection
- H. Not use the same security credentials for business and non-business purposes

If users need to access multiple services, systems or platforms, and they are required to maintain multiple separate passwords, they should be advised that they may use a single, quality password (see d) for all services where the user is assured that a reasonable level of protection has been established for the storage of the password within each service, system or platform.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Authentication  of  remote  users  can  be  achieved  using,  for  example,  a  cryptographic  based technique, hardware tokens, or a challenge/response protocol. Possible implementations of such techniques can be found in various virtual private networks (VPN solutions). Dedicated private lines can also be used to provide assurance of the source of connections.

Node authentication can serve as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users where they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility. Cryptographic techniques, e.g. based on machine certificates, can be used for node authentication. This is part of several VPN based solutions.

An identifier in or attached to, the equipment can be used to indicate whether this equipment is permitted to connect to the network. These identifiers should clearly indicate to which network the equipment is permitted to connect, if more than one network exists and particularly if these networks are of differing sensitivity. It may be necessary to consider physical protection of the equipment to maintain the security of the equipment identifier.

Routing  controls  should  be  based  on  positive  source  and  destination  address  checking mechanisms.

Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a  security  architecture  (e.g.,  routers  protecting  firewalls  or  application  gateways  residing  on protected sub-networks). Sub-networks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting external web traffic to  designated  web  servers  within  managed  interfaces  and  prohibiting  external  traffic  that appears to be spoofing internal addresses.

Wireless  technologies  include,  for  example,  microwave,  packet  radio  (UHF/VHF),  802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.

Authentication  controls  should  be  implemented  to  control  access  to  wireless  networks.  In particular, special care is needed in the selection of controls for wireless networks due to the greater opportunities for undetected interception and insertion of network traffic.

Entities should consider a number  of actions to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications outside its boundaries include, for example:

- Reducing  the  power  of  wireless  transmissions  so  that  the  transmissions  are  less  likely to  emit  a  signal  that  can  be  used  by  adversaries  outside  of  the  physical  perimeters of organizations
- Employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations
- Using  directional/beam  forming  antennas  that  reduce  the  likelihood  that  unintended receivers will be able to intercept signals

Prior  to  taking  such  actions,  entities  can  conduct  periodic  wireless  surveys  to  understand the radio frequency profile of its information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area.

| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | Built-in operating system features can extract lists of accounts with super-user privileges, both locally on individual systems and on overall domain controllers. To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and e-mail reading, security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high privileges. Such information gathering can be scripted, with short shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of such programs over the short term, but long-term or frequent use of such programs with administrative privileges could indicate that an administrator is not adhering to this control. Monitoring tools can provide such information. |

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify the systems, applications and services that require user authentication 2) Classify the identified systems, application and services based onthe level of protection needed 3) Establish the appropriate log-on and log-off procedures to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Even though most applications have secure log-on implemented, a suitable authentication technique should  be  chosen  to  substantiate  the  claimed  identity  of  a  user.  Where  strong  authentication and  identity  verification  is  required,  authentication  methods  alternative  to  passwords,  such  as cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used.

The  procedure  for  logging  into  a  system  or  application  should  be  designed  to  minimize  the opportunity for unauthorized access. The log-on procedure should therefore disclose the minimum of information about the system or application, in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance. A good log-on procedure should:

- A. Not display system or application identifiers until the log-on process has been successfully completed
- B. Display a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorized users
- C. Not provide help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user
- D. Validate the log-on information only on completion of all input data. If an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect
- E. Protect against brute force log-on attempts
- F. Log unsuccessful and successful attempts
- G. Raise a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of logon controls is detected;
- H. Display the following information on completion of a successful log-on
9. 1Date and time of the previous successful log-on
10. 2Details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on
- I. Not display a password being entered
- J. Not transmit passwords in clear text over a network
- K. Terminate inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas outside the entity's security management or on mobile devices
- L. Restrict connection times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access

Connection time controls should be considered for sensitive computer applications, especially from  high  risk  locations,  e.g.  public  or  external  areas  that  are  outside  the  entity's  security management. Examples of such restrictions include:

- A. Using  predetermined  time  slots,  e.g.  for  batch  file  transmissions,  or  regular  interactive sessions of short duration
- B. Restricting connection times to normal office hours if there is no requirement for overtime or extended-hours operation
- C. Considering re-authentication at timed intervals

A time-out facility should clear the session screen and also, possibly later, close both application and network sessions after a defined period of inactivity. The time-out delay should reflect the security risks of the area, the classification of the information being handled and the applications being used, and the risks related to the users of the equipment.

A limited form of time-out facility can be provided for some systems, which clear the screen and prevents unauthorized access but does not close down the application or network sessions.

This control should be applied for all types of users (including technical support personnel, operators, network administrators, system programmers, and database administrators). User IDs should be used to trace activities to the responsible individual. Regular user activities should not be performed from privileged accounts.

In exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear business benefit, the use of a shared user ID for a group of users or a specific job can be used. Approval by management should be documented for such cases. Additional controls may be required to maintain accountability.

Generic IDs for use by an individual should only be allowed either where the functions accessible or actions carried out by the ID do not need to be traced (e.g. read only access), or where there are other controls in place (e.g. password for a generic ID only issued to one staff at a time and logging such instance).

Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to  passwords,  such  as  cryptographic  means,  smart  cards,  tokens  or  biometric  means,  should be used.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Restrictions to access should be based on individual business application requirements. The access control policy should also be consistent with the organizational access policy.

Applying the following guidelines should be considered in order to support access restriction requirements:

- A. Providing menus to control access to application system functions
- B. Controlling the access rights of users, e.g. read, write, delete, and execute
- C. Controlling access rights of other applications
- D. Ensuring that outputs from application systems handling sensitive information contain only the information relevant to the use of the output and are sent only to authorized terminals and locations; this should include periodic reviews of such outputs to ensure that redundant information is removed

| SUB-CONTROL | 1) Identify sensitive applications and allocate the appropriate resources to ensure its security |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The following points should be considered for sensitive system isolation:

- A. The sensitivity of an application system should be explicitly identified and documented by the application owner
- B. Access to sensitive systems in data centers should be restricted by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices
- C. When a sensitive application is to run in a shared environment, the application systems with which it will share resources and the corresponding risks should be identified and accepted by the owner of the sensitive application

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

For the publishing of public information, the entity should consider the following:

- A. Define  publishing  procedures  with  required  reviews  and  approvals  for  any  information  to  be publicly available
- B. Designate  individuals  authorized  to  review  and  post  information  onto  a  publicly  accessible information system
- C. Provide  training  and  awareness  sessions  for  implicated  individuals  to  ensure  that  publicly accessible information are sanitized from nonpublic information
- D. Periodically scan  publicly accessible information  for  nonpublic  information  and  correct any inconsistency

| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | With asset inventory assembled, manyentities usetools to pull information from network assets such as switches and routers regarding the machines connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and other information from network devices that can be reconciled with the entity'sassetinventoryofservers,workstations,laptops,andotherdevices. Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to connect to the network. Going further, effective entities configure free or commercial network scanning tools to perform network sweeps on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, entities should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load history and capacities for their networks. In conducting inventory scans, scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP Echo Request) looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Usage  restrictions  and  implementation  guidance  for  mobile  devices  include,  for  example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary  operating  system  (and  possibly  other  resident  software-  integrity  checks,  and  disabling unnecessary  hardware  (e.g.,  wireless,  infrared).  Entities  are  cautioned  that  the  need  to  provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many relevant safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in the other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process.

## The entity should:

1. Prohibit  the  use  of  unclassified  mobile  devices  in  facilities  containing  information  systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information unless specifically permitted by the authorizing official (See T2.2.5)
2. Enforce  the  following  restrictions  on  individuals  permitted  by  the  authorizing  official  to  use unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information
3. 1Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified information systems is prohibited;
4. 2Connection  of  unclassified  mobile  devices  to  unclassified  information  systems  requires approval from the authorizing official
5. 3Use of internal  or  external  modems  or  wireless  interfaces  within  the  unclassified  mobile devices is prohibited
6. 4Unclassified  mobile  devices  and  the  information  stored  on  those  devices  are  subject to  random  reviews  and  inspections  by  the  assignment  security  officials,  and  if  classified information is found, the incident handling policy is followed

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

A risk-based approach used to establish data security requirements for cloud environments should consider the following:

- A. Regulatory and other requirements potentially limiting the processing, storage and retention of information in external entities, for example laws or business agreements preventing certain types of information from being stored outside national borders, privacy legislation, and / or regulatory, statutory, contractual, business, and other requirements
- B. The complete life cycle of information across entire networks, including both within cloud and non-cloud elements, as well as the interchange of information between these two elements
- C. Awareness of where sensitive information is stored and transmitted across applications, databases, servers and network infrastructure
- D. Compliance with defined retention periods and end-of-life disposal requirements
- E. Information classification and protection from unauthorized use, access, loss, destruction, and falsification
- F. Balancing the expected benefits of leveraging cloud-based services against the potential risks

| SUB-CONTROL | Each service delivery agreement for cloud services shall include provisions for: 1) Understanding and maintaining awareness of where information with applicable restrictions will be stored or transmitted in the cloud environment |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

When establishing service delivery agreement for cloud-based services, it is the entity's responsibility to define security requirements for the cloud vendor.  This should also take into consideration that the entity may have different levels of ability to negotiate these terms with a vendor based on the type of cloud services being purchased (e.g. private vs. public).

Part  of  the  entity's  responsibility  includes  understanding,  where  possible,  where  information  will be stored, processed, or transmitted to ensure that often sensitive information privacy laws and other legal restrictions (e.g. prohibiting transmission of certain types of information outside national borders) are respected.

In addition, the entity should ensure that the terms and conditions of service delivery agreements provide  ample  clarification  on  how  information  will  be  migrated  from  the  selected  cloud  service provider  to  another  provider  (or  back  to  the  entity)  at  the  termination  of  the  service  delivery agreement.  This is critical to ensuring that the entity is not 'held hostage' by the service provider.

The  information systems  acquisition, development  and  maintenance  policy  facilitates the implementation of the associated controls to integrate information security requirements into the software life cycle of information systems that contain protected data. The policy can, for example, contain in addition to the required sub-controls:

- A. Information security requirements around systems specification, correct processing, cryptography, system files, etc.
- B. Audit requirements

The information systems acquisition, development and maintenance policy can be included as part of the general information security policy, in a single policy document, or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain entities.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Information security requirements should be identified using various methods such as regulations and policies, reviews threat modeling and vulnerability thresholds/vulnerably remediation. Results from the identification should be documented merging views of all stakeholders.

Security requirements and controls should reflect the business value of the information involved and the potential negative business impact which might result from lack of adequate security.

System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security should be integrated in the early stages of information system projects. Controls introduced at the design stage  are  significantly  cheaper  to  implement  and  maintain  than  those  included  during  or  after implementation.

The sizing of information systems should take into account enabling all security features in that system; i.e.  higher  specifications  model  of  Security-Systems  so  that  when  security  features  are enabled they do not cause slow-down and degradation in the information systems performance.

For applications systems providing services or transferring information over public networks, the system requirements should also consider the following:

- A. The level of confidence each party requires in each other's claimed identity, e.g. through authentication
- B. Authorization processes associated with who may approve contents of, issuing or signing key transactional documents
- C. Ensuring that communicating partners are fully informed of their authorizations for provision or use of the service
- D. Determining and meeting requirements for confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with tendering and contract processes
- E. The level of trust required in the integrity of key documents
- F. The confidentiality of any confidential information
- G. The confidentiality and integrity of any order transactions, payment information, delivery address details and confirmation of receipts
- H. The degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer
- I. Selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment to guard against fraud

- J. The level of protection required to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of order information;
- K. Avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;
- L. Liability associated with any fraudulent transactions;
- M. Insurance requirements;
- N. Transaction related requirements such as authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of transaction related data, non-repudiation and protection of any transaction related data.

If  products are acquired, a formal testing and acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements. Where the security functionality in a proposed product does not satisfy the specified requirement then the risk introduced and associated controls should be reconsidered prior to purchasing the product.

Available guidance for security configuration of the product aligned with the final software / service stack of that system should be evaluated and implemented.

Criteria for accepting products should be defined e.g., in terms of their functionality, which give assurance that the identified security requirements are met. Products should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition. Where additional functionality is supplied and causes a security risk, this should be disabled or the proposed control structure should be reviewed to determine if advantage can be taken of the enhanced functionality available.

This  control  applies  to  external  and  internal  (in-house-  developers).  Training  of  personnel  is  an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style training, web-based/ computer-based  training,  and  hands-on  training.  Entities  can  also  request  sufficient  training materials  from  developers  to  conduct  in-house  training  or  offer  self-training  to  organizational personnel.  Entities  determine  the  type  of  training  necessary  and  may  require  different  types  of training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms.

Checks  should  be  applied  to  the  input  of  business  transactions,  standing  data  (e.g.  names  and addresses,  credit  limits,  customer  reference  numbers),  and  parameter  tables  (e.g.  sales  prices, currency conversion rates, tax rates). The following guidelines should be considered:

- A. Dual input or other input checks, such as boundary checking or limiting fields to specific ranges of input data, to detect the following errors:
2. 1Out-of-range values
3. 2Invalid characters in data fields
4. 3Missing or incomplete data
5. 4Exceeding upper and lower data volume limits
6. 5Unauthorized or inconsistent control data
- B. Periodic review of the content of key fields or data files to confirm their validity and integrity
- C. Inspecting  hard-copy  input  documents  for  any  unauthorized  changes  (all  changes  to  input documents should be authorized)
- D. Procedures for responding to validation errors
- E. Procedures for testing the plausibility of the input data
- F. Defining the responsibilities of all personnel involved in the data input process

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The design and implementation of applications should ensure that the risks of processing failures leading to a loss of integrity are minimized. Specific areas to consider include:

- A. The use of add, modify, and delete functions to implement changes to data
- B. The procedures to prevent programs running in the wrong order or running after failure of prior  processing
- C. The use of appropriate programs to recover from failures to ensure the correct processing of data
- D. Protection against attacks using buffer overruns/overflows

An appropriate checklist should be prepared, activities documented, and the results should be kept secure. Examples of checks that can be incorporated include the following:

- A. Session or batch controls, to reconcile data file balances after transaction updates
- B. Balancing controls, to check opening balances against previous closing balances, namely
3. 1Run-to-run controls
4. 2File update totals
5. 3Program-to-program controls
- C. Validation of system-generated input data
- D. Checks on the integrity, authenticity or any other security feature of data or software downloaded, or uploaded, between central and remote computers
- E. Hash totals of records and files
- F. Checks to ensure that application programs are run at the correct time
- G. Checks to ensure that programs are run in the correct order and terminate in case of a failure, and that further processing is halted until the problem is resolved
- H. Creating a log of the activities involved in the processing

When developing a cryptographic policy the following should be considered:

- A. The  management  approach  towards  the  use  of  cryptographic  controls  across  the  entity, including the general principles under which business information should be protected
- B. based on a risk  assessment,  the  required  level  of  protection  should  be  identified  taking  into account the type, strength, and quality of the encryption algorithm required
- C. The  use  of  encryption  for  protection  of  sensitive  information  transported  by  mobile  or removable media, devices or across communication lines
- D. The  approach  to  key  management,  including  methods  to  deal  with  the  protection  of cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged keys
- E. Roles and responsibilities, e.g. who is responsible for:
6. 1The implementation of the policy
7. 2The key management, including key generation
- F. These Standards to be adopted for the effective implementation throughout the entity (which solution is used for which business processes)
- G. The impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely upon content inspection (e.g. virus detection)
- H. Any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard

When  implementing  the  entity's  cryptographic  policy,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the regulations  and  national  restrictions  that  might  apply  to  the  use  of  cryptographic  techniques  in different parts of the world and to the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information.

Cryptographic controls can be used to achieve different security objectives, e.g.:

CONFIDENTIALITY: using  encryption  of  information  to  protect  sensitive  or  critical  information, either stored or transmitted

INTEGRITY/AUTHENTICITY: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to protect the authenticity and integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information

NON-REPUDIATION: using cryptographic techniques to obtain proof of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or action

Cryptographic techniques can also be used to implement the dissemination rules of information sharing, e.g. through information rights management.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification, loss, and destruction. In addition, secret  and  private  keys  need  protection  against  unauthorized  disclosure.  Equipment  used  to generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected.

A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures, and secure methods for:

- A. Generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications
- B. Generating and obtaining public key certificates
- C. Distributing keys to intended users, including how keys should be activated when received
- d. Storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys
- E. Changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this will be done
- F. Dealing with compromised keys
- G. Revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated, e.g. when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an entity (in which case keys should also be archived)
- H. Recovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management, e.g. for recovery of encrypted information
- I. Archiving keys, e.g. for information archived or backed up
- J. Destroying keys
- K. Logging and auditing of key management related activities

In order to reduce the likelihood of compromise, activation, and deactivation dates for keys should be defined so that the keys can only be used for a limited period of time. This period of time should be dependent on the circumstances under which the cryptographic control is being used, and the perceived risk.

In  addition  to  securely  managing  secret  and  private  keys,  the  authenticity  of  public  keys  should also  be  considered.  This  authentication  process  can  be  done  using  public  key  certificates  which are normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized entity with suitable controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.

The  contents  of  service  level  agreements  or  contracts  with  external  suppliers  of  cryptographic services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services.

To  minimize  the  risk  of  corruption  to  operational  systems,  the  following  guidelines  should  be considered to control changes:

- A. The updating of the operational software, applications, and program libraries should only be performed by trained administrators upon appropriate management authorization
- B. Operational systems should only hold approved executable code, and not development code or compilers
- C. Applications and operating system software should only be implemented after extensive and successful testing; the tests should include tests on usability, security, effects on other systems and user-friendliness, and should be carried out on separate systems; it should be ensured that all corresponding program source libraries have been updated
- D. A configuration control system should be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system documentation
- E. A rollback strategy should be in place before changes are implemented
- F. An audit log should be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries
- G. Previous versions of application software should be retained as a contingency measure
- H. Old  versions  of  software  should  be  archived,  together  with  all  required  information  and parameters, procedures, configuration details, and supporting software for as long as the data is retained in archive

Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The entity should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software.

Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the change, and the security of the release, i.e. the introduction of new security functionality or the number and severity of security problems affecting this version. Software patches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce security weaknesses.

Physical or logical access should only be given to suppliers for support purposes when necessary, and with management approval. The supplier's activities should be monitored. Computer software may rely on externally supplied software and modules, which should be monitored and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, which could introduce security weaknesses.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The use of operational databases containing personal information or any other sensitive information for testing purposes should be avoided. If personal or otherwise sensitive information is used for testing purposes, all sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition before use. The following guidelines should be applied to protect operational data, when used for testing purposes:

- A. The access control procedures, which apply to operational application systems, should also apply to test application systems
- B. There should be separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test application system
- C. Operational information should be erased from a test application system immediately after the testing is complete
- D. The copying and use of operational information should be logged to provide an audit trail

Access to program source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification plans  and  validation  plans)  should  be  strictly  controlled,  in  order  to  prevent  the  introduction  of unauthorized functionality and to avoid unintentional changes. For program source code, this can be achieved by controlled central storage of such code, preferably in program source libraries. The following guidelines should then be considered to control access to such program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:

- A. Where possible, program source libraries should not be held in operational systems
- B. The program source code and the program source libraries should be managed according to established procedures
- C. Support personnel should not have unrestricted access to program source libraries
- D. The updating of program source libraries  and  associated  items,  and  the  issuing  of  program sources  to  programmers  should  only  be  performed  after  appropriate  authorization  has been received
- E. Program listings should be held in a secure environment
- F. An audit log should be maintained of all accesses to program source libraries
- G. Maintenance  and  copying  of  program  source  libraries  should  be  subject  to  strict  change control procedures

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Formal change control procedures should be documented and enforced in order to minimize the corruption  of  information  systems.  Introduction  of  new  systems  and  major  changes  to  existing systems should follow a formal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control, and managed implementation.

This process should include a risk assessment, analysis of the impacts of changes, and specification of  security  controls  needed.  This  process  should  also  ensure  that  existing  security  and  control procedures are not compromised, that support programmers are given access only to those parts of the system necessary for their work, and that formal agreement and approval for any change is obtained.

Wherever practicable, application and operational change control procedures should be integrated. The change procedures should include:

- A. Maintaining a record of agreed authorization levels
- B. Ensuring changes are submitted by authorized users
- C. Reviewing controls and integrity procedures to ensure that they will not be compromised by the changes
- D. Identifying all software, information, database entities, and hardware that require amendment
- E. Obtaining formal approval for detailed proposals before work commences
- F. Ensuring authorized users accept changes prior to implementation
- G. Ensuring that the system documentation set is updated on the completion of each change and that old documentation is archived or disposed of
- H. Maintaining a version control for all software updates
- I. Maintaining an audit trail of all change requests
- J. Ensuring  that  operating  documentation  and  user  procedures  are  changed  as  necessary  to remain appropriate
- K. Ensuring that the implementation of changes takes place at the right time and does not disturb the business processes involved

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

## This process should cover:

- A. Review  of  application  control  and  integrity  procedures  to  ensure  that  they  have  not  been compromised by the operating system changes
- B. Ensuring that the annual support plan and budget will cover reviews and system testing resulting from operating system changes
- C. Ensuring that notification of operating system changes is provided in time to allow appropriate tests and reviews to take place before implementation
- D. Ensuring that appropriate changes are made to the business continuity plans

A specific group or individual should be given responsibility for monitoring vulnerabilities and vendors' releases of patches and fixes.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Define whois entitled to approve changes to software/applications 2) Test any change in a testing environment before moving it to production environment 3) In case of major changes in critical software and applications, perform a Secure Code Review |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

As  far  as  possible,  and  practicable,  vendor-supplied  software  packages  should  be  used  without modification.  Where  a  software  package  needs  to  be  modified  the  following  points  should be considered:

- A. The risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised
- B. Whether the consent of the vendor should be obtained
- C. The possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates
- D. The impact if the entity becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes

If changes are necessary the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a clearly identified  copy.  A  software  update  management  process  should  be  implemented  to  ensure  the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied if necessary to future  software  upgrades.  If  required,  the  modifications  should  be  tested  and  validated  by  an independent evaluation body.

The following should be considered to limit the risk of information leakage, e.g. through the use and exploitation of covert channels:

- A. Scanning of outbound media and communications for hidden information
- B. Masking and modulating system and communications behavior to reduce the likelihood of a third party being able to deduce information from such behavior
- C. Making  use  of  systems  and  software  that  are  considered  to  be  of  high  integrity,  e.g.  using evaluated products
- D. Regular  monitoring  of  personnel  and  system  activities,  where  permitted  under  existing legislation or regulation
- E. Monitoring resource usage in computer systems

| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE   | A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration of systems. Some entities have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or even across entities it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemesandlanguages:CVE,CCE,OVAL,CPE,CVSS,and/orXCCDF. Advancedvulnerabilityscanningtoolscanbeconfiguredwithusercredentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensive scans than can be achieved without login credentials. The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of eachvendor. In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across the network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings and configurations of local machines on which they are installed. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight into unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security weaknessesbyadministrators. Effective entities link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

As a prerequisite, a current and complete inventory of assets is needed (including software vendor, version numbers, current state of deployment, and the person(s) within the entity responsible for the software).

The  following  guidance  should  be  followed  to  establish  an  effective  management  process  for technical vulnerabilities:

- A. The entity should define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment (see M2.2), patching, asset tracking, and any coordination responsibilities required
- B. The entity should identify information resources that will be used to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities and to maintain awareness about them should be identified for software and other technology (based on the asset inventory list); these information resources should be updated based on changes in the inventory, or when other new or useful resources are found
- C. The entity should define a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities
- D. The  entity  should  identify  the  risks  associated  to  potential  technical  vulnerability  and  the actions to be taken; such action could involve patching of vulnerable systems and/or applying other controls
- E. Depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, the action taken should be carried out according to the controls related to change management or by following information security incident response procedures
- F. If a patch is available, the risks associated with installing the patch should be assessed (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the patch)

- G. patches should be tested and evaluated before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated; if no patch is available, other controls should be considered, such as
2. 1turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability
3. 2adapting or adding access controls, e.g. firewalls, at network borders
4. 3increased monitoring to detect or prevent actual attacks
5. 4raising awareness of the vulnerability
- H. an audit log should be kept for all procedures undertaken
- I. the technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency
- J. systems at high risk should be addressed first

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The use of acquisition and procurement processes by entities early in the system development life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. Entities use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of acquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are a number of different tools and techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information system or system component, using blind or filtered buys). Entities also consider creating incentives for suppliers who:

- A. Implement required security controls
- B. Promote transparency into their organizational processes and security practices
- C. Provide  additional  vetting  of  the  processes  and  security  practices  of  subordinate  suppliers, critical information system components, and services
- D. Restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries
- E. Provide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components

In addition, entities consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required delivery to  limit  opportunities  for  adversaries  to  corrupt  information  system  components  or  products. Finally, entities can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and warehousing options to reduce supply  chain  risk  (e.g.,  requiring  tamper-evident  packaging  of  information  system  components during shipping and warehousing).

- B. Assessment of supplier training and experience in developing systems, components, or services with the required security capability

These reviews provide entities with increased levels of visibility into supplier activities during the system development life cycle to promote more effective supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to determine whether primary suppliers have security controls in place and a  practice  for  vetting  subordinate  suppliers,  for  example,  second-  and  third-tier  suppliers,  and any subcontractors.

Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat. Security controls to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully identifying and targeting the supply chain include, for example:

- A. Avoiding  the  purchase  of  custom  configurations  to  reduce  the  risk  of  acquiring  information systems, components, or products that have been corrupted via supply chain actions targeted at specific entities
- B. Employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit the potential harm from any given supplier in the supply chain
- C. Using procurement carve outs

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Supply  chain  information  includes,  for  example:  user  identities;  uses  for  information  systems, information  system  components,  and  information  system  services;  supplier  identities;  supplier processes;  security  requirements;  design  specifications;  testing  and  evaluation  results;  and system/component configurations. This control enhancement expands the scope of operations security  (OPSEC)  to  include  suppliers  and  potential  suppliers.  OPSEC  is  a  process  of  identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to operations and other activities to:

- A. Identify those actions that can be observed by potential adversaries
- B. Determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to entities
- C. Implement  controls  or  countermeasures  to  eliminate  or  reduce  to  an  acceptable  level, exploitable vulnerabilities
- D. Consider how aggregated information may compromise the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain

OPSEC may require entities to withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or information system services.

For some information system components, especially hardware, there are technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered. Security controls used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information system components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology  tagging  and  side-channel  analysis,  hashes  comparison  mechanisms also can be used to verify if vender or third party software has been altered or not. For hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with embedded logic complete with component and production location.

The  information  security  incident  management  policy  facilitates  the  implementation  of  the associated controls to ensure appropriate reaction to any actual or suspected security incidents relating  to  information  assets.  The  policy  can,  for  example,  contain  in  addition  to  the  required sub-controls:

- A. Incident classification
- B. Procedure for reporting information security events or weaknesses
- C. Procedure for incident handling

The information systems acquisition, development and maintenance policy can be included as part of the general information security policy, in a single policy document, or can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain entities.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard (also refer to National Cyber Response Framework).

The entity should consider the following:

## A. Develop an incident response plan that:

- 1Provides the entity with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability
- 2Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability
- 3Provides a  high-level  approach  for  how  the  incident  response  capability  fits  into  the overall entity
- 4Meets the unique requirements of the entity, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions
- 5Defines reportable incidents
- 6Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the entity
- 7Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability
- 8Is reviewed and approved by defined personnel or roles

- B. Make the incident response plan available to defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role- and organizational elements;
- C. Review and test the incident response plan in defined frequency;
- D. Update the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
- E. Communicate  incident  response  plan  changes  to  defined  incident  response  personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements; and
- F. Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

It  is  important  that  entities  develop  and  implement  a  coordinated  approach  to  incident response.  Organizational  missions,  business  functions,  strategies,  goals,  and  objectives  for incident response help to determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a comprehensive incident response capability, entities consider the coordination and sharing of information with external entities, including, for example, external service providers and entities involved in the supply chain for organizational information systems.

Critical  entities  shall  also  take  into  account  any  other  NESA's  relevant  issuances,  guidance,  and activities in this regard (also refer to National Cyber Response Framework).

Entities  should  identify  members  in  the  entity  to  form  the  proper  CSIRT.  The  establishment  of the  team  should  take  place  before  developing  the  Incident  Response  plan.  One  of  the  CSIRT's responsibilities is to create the IR Plan.

Here are some of the CSIRT members:

- Team leader who is usually a senior manager whose responsibility is to take charge of incidents and direct actions to other team members
- Boundary protection experts. Normally individuals that are expert in firewalls, routers and IDSs that sits at the edge of the network.

- Network administrators
- Physical security members
- Human resources might be involved if the attach was originated by an employee
- Communication  might  be  involved to become  the  public face for incidents that became public.

Here are some of the primary responsibilities of the CSIRT:

- Develop incident policy, plan, and procedures
- Response to incidents and minimizing the impact
- Investigate incidents and determine the cause
- prevent future incident by recommending security controls
- Handle  incident  reporting  and  communication  to  all  stakeholder  involved  internally and externally
- Protect collected evidence

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Classification and prioritization of incidents can help to identify the impact and extent of an incident.  A  point  of  contact  should  assess  the  information  security  events  using  the  agreed information  security  event  and  incident  classification  scale  and  decide  whether  the  events should be classified as information security incidents.

In case where the entity has CSIRT, the assessment and decision can be forwarded to the CSIRT for confirmation or reassessment. Results of the assessment and decision should be recorded in detail for the purpose of future reference and verification.

An attack is classified as an incident if the attack is directed against information assets, has a  realistic  chance  of  success  and  threatens  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability  of information resources and assets.

An indication of an incident can be one or more of the following:

- If dormant or inactive accounts started accessing system resources, querying servers, or engaged in other activities
- If modification of logs occurs and the systems administrator cannot determine explicitly the authorized individual who modified them
- Presence of hacking tools
- Notifications by partner or peer
- Notification by the attacker

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

In designing the incident response training, entities should customize the content and level of details based on the targeted audience to allow attendees to focus on the information that is relevant to them.

As such, end users may only need to identify an incident or suspicious activities and call the right contact, system administrators may require technical training on how to handle/remediate incidents, and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The  entity  should  develop  testing  procedures  to  determine  the  overall  effectiveness  of  its incident  response  capabilities  and  to  identify  potential  weaknesses  or  deficiencies.  Incident response testing must simulate pre-defined breach scenarios across the incident response lifecycle  from  including  detection,  reporting,  and  recovery  to  normal  operations.  Incident response  testing  includes,  for  example,  the  use  of  checklists,  tabletop  (discussion-based) exercises, and functional (performance of duties in a simulated environment) exercises. Entities should  participate  in  sector,  national,  and  international  exercises  to  further  test  incident response capabilities.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

The entity should provide an incident response support resources as part of its incident response capability to provide advice and assistance to users of the information system during steady state operation and incidents for the detection, handling and reporting of security incidents.

The entity should provide an incident response support resources in different forms to reach the widest audience, such as:

- Informative website
- Online knowledge base
- Call center, etc.

Moreover, the entity should coordinate with external providers (for example, national CERT) through its incident response capability for help in the detection and handling of incidents within the entity.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Establish detailed incident records including all related activities and outcomes where applicable 2) Develop lessons learned and where applicable identify additional controls to avoid similar incidents in the future |

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

There  should  be  mechanisms  in  place  to  enable  the  types,  volumes,  costs,  and  impacts  of information security incidents to be quantified and monitored. The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to identify recurring or high impact incidents and inform risk assessment and risk treatment activities.

Investigations based on information distributed by an information sharing community should be performed, to reduce the risks of similar incidents and develop a better understanding of the  risks  facing  the  community  and  any  related  significant  information  infrastructures.  Such investigations  could  be  performed  by  the  community  members  involved,  or  by  a  supporting entity, if one exists.

Following reported incidents, post incident reviews should be performed by members of the information sharing community to trigger updates to security incident response plans, related procedures  and  the  business  risk  profile,  and  implementation  of  additional  controls  even  if the member was not affected by the incident in question. Each member should ensure that reported  incident  responses  are  assessed,  and  any  lessons  or  possible  improvements  to the member's own processes are identified and acted upon to continuously improve its own response processes.

| SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Identify the requirements of the applicable jurisdictions 2) Establish procedures for collecting evidence taking into account : • Chain of custody • Safety of evidence • Safety of the personnel • Roles and responsibilities of personnel involved • Competency of the personnel • Documentation • Briefing • Other identified requirements |

Internal  procedures  should  be  developed  and  followed  when  dealing  with  evidence  for  the purposes of disciplinary and legal action.

Identification  is  the  process  involving  the  search  for,  recognition  and  documentation  of potential evidence. Collection is the process of gathering the physical items that can contain potential evidence. Acquisition is the process of creating a copy of data within a defined set. Preservation is the process to maintain and safeguard the integrity and original condition of the potential evidence.

In general, the procedures for evidence should provide processes of identification, collection, acquisition and preservation in accordance with different types of media, devices and status of devices, e.g., powered on or off. The procedures should take account of:

- A Chain of custody
- B Safety of evidence
- C Safety of the personnel
- D Roles and responsibilities of personnel involved
- E Competency of the personnel
- F Documentation
- G Briefing

Where available, certification or other relevant means of qualification of personnel and tools should be sought, so as to strengthen the value of the preserved evidence.

Forensic  evidence  may  transcend  organizational  or  jurisdictional  boundaries.  In  such  cases, it  should be ensured that the entity is entitled to collect the required information as forensic evidence. The requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize chances of admission across the relevant jurisdictions.

| AUTOMATION GUIDANCE                 | For an automated identification of weaknesses, a large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available. Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or evenacross entities, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF. Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensivescansthancanbeachievedwithoutlogincredentials.The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Also, event log collectors and incident management systems should be considered. These technologies provide log collection, normalization, correlation and analysis: they can be very helpful both to detect incidents in their early stages and to investigate incidents. |

Priority  information  is  information  that  may  enable  other  community  members  to  avoid  or minimize similar undesirable events. It is important that such information is shared urgently, even if it is not fully analyzed or confirmed. The legal department, security vendors, third-party cyber threat intelligence providers, as well as the regulator should discuss what information can be shared and with whom.

A security weakness (or vulnerability) is a flow which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance.

All  employees,  contractors  and  external  party  users  should  report  these  matters  to  the point of contact as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security incidents. The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible and available as possible. They should be informed that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected weakness. Testing weaknesses might be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and could also cause damage to the information system or service and result in legal liability for the individual performing the testing.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

An entity should determine whether the continuity of information security is captured within the BCM process or within the (IT) disaster recovery management (DRM- process. Information security requirements should be determined when planning for business continuity and disaster recovery.

In  the  absence  of  formal  business  continuity  and  disaster  recovery  planning,  information security management should assume that information security requirements remain the same in adverse situations, compared to normal operational conditions. Alternatively, an organization could perform a business impact analysis (BIA- for information security aspects to determine the information security requirements applicable to adverse situations.

The process of including information security in the business continuity management should bring together the following key elements of business continuity management:

- A. Understanding the risks the entity is facing in terms of likelihood and impact in time, including an identification and prioritization of critical business processes
- B. Identifying all the assets involved in critical business processes
- C. Understanding  the  impact  which  interruptions  caused  by  information  security  incidents are likely to have on the business (it is important that solutions are found that will handle incidents causing smaller impact, as well as serious incidents that could threaten the viability of the entity), and establishing the business objectives of information systems
- D. Considering the purchase of suitable insurance which may form part of the overall business continuity process, as well as being part of operational risk management
- E. Identifying and considering the implementation of additional preventive and mitigating controls
- F. Identifying  sufficient  financial,  organizational,  technical,  and  environmental  resources  to address the identified information security requirements
- G. Ensuring the safety of personnel  and  the protection of  information  systems  and organizational property

The process should bring together the following key elements of business continuity management:

- A. Formulating  and  documenting  business  continuity  plans  addressing  information  security requirements in line with the agreed business continuity strategy;
- B. Regular testing and updating of the plans and processes put in place;
- C. Ensuring  that  the  management  of  business  continuity  is  incorporated  in  the  entity's processes and structure; responsibility for the business continuity management process should be assigned at an appropriate level within the entity.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA's relevant issuances, guidance, and activities in this regard.

The continuity planning process should consider the following:

- A. Identification and agreement of all responsibilities and continuity procedures
- B. Identification of the acceptable loss of information and services
- C. Implementation of the procedures to allow recovery and restoration of business operations and  availability  of  information  in  required  time-scales;  particular  attention  needs  to  be given to the assessment of internal and external business dependencies and the contracts in place
- D. Operational procedures to follow pending completion of recovery and restoration
- E. Documentation of agreed procedures and processes
- F. Appropriate  education  of  staff  in  the  agreed  procedures  and  processes,  including crisis management
- G. Testing and updating of the plans

The  planning  process  should  focus  on  the  required  business  objectives,  e.g.  restoring  of specific communication services to customers in an acceptable amount of time. The services and resources facilitating this should be identified, including staffing,  non-information processing resources, as well as fallback arrangements for information systems. Such fallback arrangements may include arrangements with third parties in the form of reciprocal agreements, or commercial subscription services.

If alternative temporary locations are used, the level of implemented security controls at these locations should be equivalent to the main site.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)

Business  continuity  plan  tests  should  ensure  that  all  members  of  the  recovery  team  and other relevant staff are aware of the plans and their responsibility for business continuity and information security and know their role when a plan is invoked.

The test schedule for business continuity plan(s) should indicate how and when each element of the plan should be tested. Each element of the plan(s) should be tested frequently.

A variety of techniques should be used in order to provide assurance that the plan(s) will operate in real life. These should include:

- A. Table-top  testing  of  various  scenarios  (discussing  the  business  recovery  arrangements using example interruptions)
- B. Simulations (particularly for training people in their post-incident/crisis management roles)
- C. Technical recovery testing (ensuring information systems can be restored effectively)
- D. Testing recovery at an alternate site (running business processes in parallel with recovery operations away from the main site)

- E. Tests of supplier facilities and services (ensuring externally provided services and products will meet the contracted commitment)
- F. Complete rehearsals (testing that the entity, personnel, equipment, facilities, and processes can cope with interruptions)

These techniques can be used by any entity. They should be applied in a way that is relevant to the specific recovery plan. The results of tests should be recorded and actions taken to improve the plans, where necessary.

Responsibility  should  be  assigned  for  regular  reviews  of  each  business  continuity  plan.  The identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business continuity plans  should  be  followed  by  an  appropriate  update  of  the  plan.  This  formal  change  control process should ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of the complete plan.

Examples of changes where updating of business continuity plans should be considered are acquisition of new equipment, upgrading of systems and changes in:

- Personnel
- Addresses or telephone numbers
- Business strategy
- Location, facilities, and resources
- Legislation
- Contractors, suppliers, and key customers
- Processes, or new or withdrawn ones
- Risk (operational and financial)

## SUMMARY OF THE PRIORITIZED CONTROLS

The  following  table  provides  a  list  of  the  prioritized  security  controls.  As  a  recap,  the  concept  of 'Prioritization' relates to grouping the security controls in order of importance for realizing a minimum level of information assurance protection, and for enabling a phased and incremental implementation of this Standard.

Overall, the distribution of security controls across the four priority levels is outlined in Table 6, and the detailed listing is provided in Table 7, below.

## TABLE 6: DISTRIBUTION OF SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS PRIORITY LEVELS

## MAPPING OF THREATS TO CONTROLS

The following table provides examples of typical threats along with their mitigating controls. The list of threats types are aggregated from benchmark risk registers and mapped to mitigating controls to assist implementing entities during their risk assessment process.

Overall,  a  number  of  security  controls  are  needed  to  mitigate  specific  threat  types  given  the  complex nature of the threats. As such, threat types along with their corresponding mitigating controls are outlined in Table 9 below.

## SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVEL CONTROLS

The following table provides a list of the sector and national level security controls. As a recap, sector and national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes.

Overall, the UAE IA Standards provides a total of 15 sector and national level controls as outlined in Table 10 below.
