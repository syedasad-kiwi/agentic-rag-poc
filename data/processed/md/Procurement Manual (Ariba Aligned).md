## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Introduction to Procurement Manual

## 1.1.1 Purpose of the Procurement Manual

The  Procurement  Manual  provides  operational  procedures  to  the Procurement practitioners.  It reinforces the Procurement Standards, the Procurement Charter, and the Procurement Delegation of Authority (PDoA), giving a more detailed explanation of their application.

## 1.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Manual

The Procurement Manual applies to all procurement activities conducted by the government Entities and  the  Government  Procurement  Office  (GPO).  The  Executive  Council  (EC),  or  a  relevant  body authorised by the EC, may exclude an Entity from the application of the Procurement Manual. The Procurement  Manual  covers  all  relevant  procurement  processes  and  serves  as  the  operational framework.

## 1.1.2.(I) List of Exemptions

The Procurement Manual does not apply to:

- 1) Staff salaries and benefits.
- 2) Direct employment contracts or the engagement individual experts which cannot be subject to tender.
- 3) General  and  administration  expenses  for  non-predefined  technical  specifications,  electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals provided to the employees and governed by the housing policies,  professional  and  non-professional  bodies'  subscriptions,  fee  paid  to  organisers  of conferences/exhibitions.
- 4) Agreements  among  government  Entities  or  with  international  professional  bodies  for  the purposes of research/collaboration/promotions.
- 5) Sponsorships and grants.
- 6) Purchase of artworks, artifacts, and associated ancillary expenses.
- 7) Copyrights license fees except where there is a contractual obligation to purchase goods, services or projects.
- 8) Reimbursement of adhoc expenses incurred during travel (below Petty Cash threshold).
- 9) Mandatory or Regulatory fees (such as court fees, duties and taxes, bank fees etc.)
- 10) Any other exceptions approved by the Executive Council (EC).

## 1.1.3 Structure of the Manual

The structure of the Procurement Manual is aligned to the Procurement Capability Model (refer to Figure 1.3.1):

- 1) Level 1 - Procurement capabilities are classified into Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support capabilities.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 2) Level 2 - Each procurement capability includes one or more procurement process group.
- 3) Level 3 - Each procurement process group consists of procurement processes.

Important  Note:  All  Procurement  processes  must  be  executed  in  line  with  the  Procurement Standards.

Procurement process groups are enabled through 'SAP Ariba modules'. They are covered in the manual as per the following structure:

1. Overview of the Process Group
2. Overview of the 'SAP Ariba module'
3. Details of level 3 Processes
- i. (B) Scope and Purpose
- ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks
- iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities
- iv. (B) Process Summary
4. Work Aids - Forms and Documents
5. RACI Matrix
6. References to 'SAP Ariba Procurement User Guide'

Sections marked with a (B) -prefix elaborate the business aspects of the procurement processes and sections marked with an (S) -prefix describe the 'SAP Ariba' aspects of the procurement processes.

References  to  'SAP  Ariba  Procurement  User  Guide' section provides  reference  to  the  section detailing the respective system tasks and functionalities in the 'SAP Ariba User Guide'.

Procurement process maps, lists of tables and figures, and glossary of terms  and definitions  are provided in the Appendix.

Procurement practitioners reading this manual should consider the following points:

- 1) Procurement business roles are in bold Italic (e.g., Sourcing Specialist ) while system roles are in 'double quotes'(e.g., 'Project Owner').
- 2) Key business terms, keywords, and documents are in 'single quotes' (e.g., 'Supplier Segmentation Report', 'Sourcing Strategy', etc.).
- 3) Key system terms, keywords, and documents are highlighted in  "double quotes" (e.g., 'Sourcing Request', 'Contract Workspace' etc.).
- 4) Matters critical from a feasibility or compliance perspective are highlighted as Important Note (e.g., Important  Note:  All  Procurement  processes  must  be  executed  in  line  with  the Procurement Standards ).
- 5) Reference  to  other  documents  or  sections  within  the  Procurement  Manual  is  highlighted  as underlined  italics (e.g.,  Please  refer  to section  2.5.3.(II) for  the  details  of  the  'Supplier Development and Collaboration' processes).

## 1.2 Procurement Operating Model

The Procurement consists  of  the  Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement .  The Procurement Operating Model provides mandate, empowerment, and responsibilities of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement .

<!-- image -->

## Figure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model

The Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives:

- 1) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories.
- 2) Providing shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training.
- 3) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the Procurement .
- 4) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate).
- 5) Running market development initiatives and managing partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities.

Entity Procurement is  responsible  for  procurement  of  the  Entity-Specific  Categories  including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO.

<!-- image -->

The GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources as needed  for  procuring  Common  Categories.  The  Entity Procurement engages End-Users and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.

## 1.2.1 Category Classification

Classification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.

Figure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories

<!-- image -->

## 1.2.2 Category Taxonomy

Category taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is deployed in 'SAP Ariba'.  It is a  four-level  taxonomy  with  each  record  represented  with  an  eight-digit  number  and  unique  name, illustrated below:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Figure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations in 'SAP Ariba modules'

The four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code.

All Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. Suppliers are registered in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the Department of Government Support (DGS), at Level 2 UNSPSC categories, and line items are created in 'SAP Ariba' at Level 3 UNSPSC categories.

## 1.3 Procurement Capability Model

The Procurement Capability Model comprises of four types of procurement capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below:

| Strategic   | Procurement Strategy        | Procurement Strategy            | Demand and Category Management   | Demand and Category Management                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tactical    | Source to Contract Contract | Source to Contract Contract     | Lifecycle Management             | Supplier Performance and Relationship Management |
| Operational | Requisition to Pay          | Requisition to Pay              | Requisition to Pay               | Requisition to Pay                               |
| Support     | Risk and Regulation         | Supplier Master Data Management | Item Master Data Management      | User Master Data Management                      |

## 1.4 Procurement Benefits

This section provides the details regarding:

- 1) Definition of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits
- 2) General principles that apply to Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits
- 3) Methodologies to calculate the Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits

## 1.4.1 Definitions

## i. Baseline Spend

Baseline  Spend  is  the  foundation  of  the  Procurement  Benefits  calculation.  It  is  the  value  of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process.

## ii. Classification of Procurement Benefits

Procurement Benefits can be classified into Cost Reduction, Cost Avoidance, and Cash Impact. Details of the same are provided below:

| Cost 'same                                                                                                                                       | Reduction for less' Cost Avoidance 'avoiding future cost'                                                                                                                                                        | Cash Impact                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Benefits that directly reduce the cost base compared to the baseline  Costs can be one-offs or recurring/sustainable                          |  Cost was not included in the original baseline  Action taken now to avoid future incremental costs  Could include initiatives that lead to cost reduction in the future                                      | Definition  One - time impact of increased cash                                                                      |
|  Reduction in cost of software licenses resulting from optimization  A one-time saving such as a rebate or volume reduction in the prior year. |  Consumption reduced because of increase in efficiency or optimization  Price increase as a result of external factors, e.g. an increase in regulatory minimum wage, is offset by a reduced agency fee mark-up | Example  Cash impact due outstanding payables with Supplier (increased 'Payment Terms')  Sale or decrease inventory |
|  Hard benefits (savings or additional revenue) vs Baseline Spend  Spend reduction year-over- year                                              |  No increase in year-over-year spend particular to the relevant cost avoidance initiative (e.g., demand optimization)  Cost avoidance demonstrated by comparing the variance in volume and price.              | Measurement  One - time impact demonstrated by estimating benefits.                                                  |

## 1.4.2 General Principles

Following general principles apply to the calculation of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits:

## i. Baseline principles

- 1) An agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the End-User , the Finance and the Procurement .
- 2) Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.).
- 3) The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as  Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc.
- 4) An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit.

## ii. Procurement Benefits calculation principles

- 1) Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).
- 2) Benefits implementation  costs  (one-time investments) are excluded from  the benefits calculation.

## 1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies

## i. Baseline Spend

Baseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:

## Baseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price

Total volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed below:

| Method                      | Situation           | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Demand Plan Forecast Volume | Forecast is known   |  100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Historic forecast volume    | Forecast is unknown |  50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %) In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned. |

## Table 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies

Baseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:

<!-- image -->

## 1) Historic price baseline

Historic price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:

Table 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price - Calculation Methodologies

| Price Method                | Situation                                                                                                     | Method                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Last Price Paid             | Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.).   |  Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or  Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available |
| Average Price               | Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities)                         |  Average Price paid over the last year                                                                                |
| Average quoted Market Price | Used in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available) |  Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the Suppliers                                            |

## 2) Comparable price baseline

If  a  certain  goods/service/projects has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot  be  established.  In  such  cases,  the  baseline  price  can  be  estimated  using  comparable goods/services/projects  (identical  or  similar  specifications)  where  the  price  is  known.  (e.g., estimating  the  baseline  price  for  a  car  rental  service  by  comparing  it  with  similar  services previously purchased by another Entity).

## 3) New price baseline

If  neither  a  historic  nor  a  comparable  baseline  can  be  established,  a  new  baseline  can  be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers . The baseline price  will  be  calculated  as  an  average  of  the  approved  initial  quotes.  Any  price  reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.

## ii. Procurement Benefits

As illustrated in Table 1.4.1, Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:

## 1) Cost Savings

Following are the various Cost Savings scenarios:

## a. Standard Method (last paid price - new price)

This  method  is  used  when  the  savings  result  from  the  difference  between  baseline  and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

Savings = (baseline price - negotiated price) * volume

<!-- image -->

## b. Free of charges Extra

These are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/services/projects offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume

## c. Fluctuating market price with market Index

This method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method  is  applicable  for  commodities  (crude  oil,  metals,  agri-commodities,  etc.)  where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = Forecasted spend with historical index value - forecasted spend with new index value

## d. Fluctuating market price without market Index

This method of calculation is used when  there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = (Initial offer - negotiated offer) * expected volume

## e. Volume Rebate

This method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = (new rebate per unit - old rebate per unit) * volume

## f. Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization

For some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications  examples  may  include  (but  not  limited  to)  using  black  and  white  printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using  standard  event  designs  instead  of  specialized  events.  Savings  in  this  scenario  are calculated as follows:

## Savings = (Cost for original item/service - cost for substitute item/service) * volume

## g. In-house vs. Outsourcing

For some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

Savings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) - purchase price) x volume

<!-- image -->

## h. Lease vs. Buy

For some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume

## i. Reduced Cost of Disposal

At the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = Historic cost for disposal - new cost for disposal

## 2) Cost Avoidance

Following are various Cost Avoidance scenario:

## a. Demand reduction/yield improvement

This method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service/projects has been reduced through active negotiations by Procurement , (i.e., demand control). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = (Last volume  - negotiated new volume) * last price

## b. Reduced cost of service

This method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

## Savings = (Historic service cost - new service cost)

## 3) Cash Impact

Following are the various Cash Impact scenarios:

## a. Inventory reduction

This  method  is  used  when  the  involvement  of Procurement leads  to  a  reduction  of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

Savings = (Old Inventory levels - New Inventory levels) x WACC

(WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

<!-- image -->

## b. Payment term extension

This method is used when the involvement of Procurement results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

Savings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC

(VAT - Value added tax; WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

## 1.5 Legislations applicable for Procurement

## 1.5.1 Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC)

The Abu Dhabi Local Content Program aims to direct government spending towards the development of the local economy in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The tenders published by government entities must  ask  for  the  submission  of  the  ICV  Certificate,  sponsored  by  the  Department  of  Economic Development of Abu Dhabi.

The weight given to the local content must constitute 40% of the overall score allocated to the financial/commercial  evaluation  score.  The  program  will  encourage  suppliers  to  participate  in government tenders to increase their economic contribution in Abu Dhabi through Emiratization, Investments, and Locally procured goods and services. For further information regarding the Abu Dhabi Local Content program, please visit https://idb.added.gov.ae/

## 1.5.2 Economic Incentives for MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises)

## 2. Procurement Processes Groups

## 2.1 Procurement Strategy

## 2.1.1 Overview

'Procurement  Strategy'  is  a  high-level  document  that  states  an  Entity's  approach  to  achieving  its procurement  objectives,  executing  its  activities  and  key  initiatives.  The  'Procurement  Strategy'  is created with mid-to-long term perspective and updated yearly.  Key elements of value proposition addressed by the 'Procurement Strategy' include (but not limited to):

Figure 2.1.1 Value Proposition - Procurement Strategy

<!-- image -->

'Procurement Strategy' guides on allocation of resources and budget for strategic initiatives.

The 'Procurement Strategy' aligns procurement activities with the overall Entity strategy  and Abu .Dhabi  Governmental  initiatives  The Head  of  Procurement is  responsible  for  the  creation  of  the Procurement Strategy. The Head of Procurement assigns key members from Procurement to create and monitor execution of the 'Procurement Strategy'.

Development  of  the  'Procurement  Strategy'  is  an  offline  process.  Following  are  the  key  steps  to develop a 'Procurement Strategy':

## 2.1.1.(I) Step 1 - Internal and External Analysis

## i. Analyze procurement practice

The assigned key members conduct an analysis of the Entity Procurement on following aspects to identify procurement optimization initiatives:

- 1) People

<!-- image -->

- 2) Processes
- 3) Technology
- 4) Governance.

This leads to a better understanding the Procurement from the perspective of operating processes, organizational excellence, and knowledge and information management. Post this analysis, various models (such as SWOT analysis) can be utilized to identify the key competencies and major areas of improvement.

## ii. Spend analysis

In  addition  to  above, spend  data  may  be  collated  and  analysed  for  additional  optimization opportunities.  This  analysis  provides  insights  into  historical  spend, Supplier base,  and  spend categories  to identify the focus areas for improvement.

## iii. Market analysis

Assigned key members analyse the evolution of markets, trends and conditions to assess their impact on the Procurement . The necessary data may be collected through primary and secondary sources. This data is updated over time, to maintain relevance. Various methodologies, such as Porter's five forces (industry rivalry, buyer power,  Supplier power,  threat to new  entrant, substitution possibilities),  TOWS  (Threat,  Opportunities,  Weakness,  and  Strengths)  and  PESTLE  (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis may be used.

## iv. Benchmarking

A  'Competitive  Assessment',  conducted  through  survey  and  benchmarking,  may  show  Entity's strengths / weaknesses with respect to industry best practices.

The 'Procurement Strategy' addresses the areas of improvements and adjustments required to remain relevant with respect to the changes in the market.

## 2.1.1.(II) Step 2 - Develop Procurement Strategy

The 'Procurement Strategy' includes the following:

## i. Vision and Mission

The vision and mission of the Procurement is derived from the vision and mission of the Entity.

## ii. Goals / Objectives

Based on the analysis done in previous sections, assigned members develop clear objectives for the Procurement .  Following are few examples of objectives and associated guiding principles for the Procurement :

## iii. Key Initiatives

The  objectives  identified  in  the  'Procurement  Strategy'  are  achieved  through  initiatives.  The initiatives  are  expressed  with  measurable  outputs.  These  identified  initiatives  must  be  SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely). Following are the examples of initiatives and outputs:

Table 2.1.2 Examples - Procurement Initiatives and Outputs

| Procurement Objective                                               | Initiatives                                                                                                                        | Output                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Execute Strategic Sourcing to meet requirements at competitive cost |  Conduct Strategic Sourcing for categories contributing to top 80% of the Entity Spend                                            |  Achieve xx% annual savings across Common Categories                          |
| Enhance visibility and control on Entity spend                      |  Conclude demand gathering by Q3  Analyse tail spend (bottom 20%) to identify opportunities of increasing spend under compliance |  Decrease unplanned spend by xx%  Increase spend coverage under PR-PO by xx% |
| Reduce cycle times for procurement processes                        |  Include draft contract agreements in 100% of tenders                                                                             |  Decrease cycle time of contract signing by x%                                |

## 2.2 Demand and Category Management (DCM)

## 2.2.1 Overview

Demand and Category Management (DCM) process group consists of procedures associated with the creation, approval, execution, and monitoring of 'Category Strategy' and 'Procurement Plan'.

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the DCM processes.

<!-- image -->

Below is an illustration of the DCM Level 3 processes:

Figure 2.2.1 DCM Procurement Processes (Level 3)

<!-- image -->

## 2.2.2 'SAP Ariba Modules' Overview

The DCM process group is enabled through 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Category Management)' and 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)', as illustrated below:

Figure 2.2.2 DCM processes and 'SAP Ariba' Stages

<!-- image -->

The Category Management is enabled by the 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Projects (Category Management)'.  Each  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  is  specific  to  one  category. 'Knowledge Projects  (Category  Management)'  is  created  and  managed  at  GPO  level  for  Common Categories  and  at  each  Entity  level  for  Entity-Specific  Categories.  A Sourcing  Specialist/Lead with knowledge  and  previous  experience  of  the  category  is  assigned  to  lead  the  category  planning, management, and procurement activities. This Sourcing Specialist/Lead is the 'Category Manager' for the  category  and  is  assigned  as  the  'Project  owner'  for  the  'Knowledge  Projects  (Category Management)'.

<!-- image -->

Procurement  Planning is  enabled  by  the  'SAP  Ariba  Knowledge  Projects  (Procurement  Demand Planning)'. Each 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' is specific to an Entity/GPO. A 'Knowledge  Project  (Procurement  Demand  Planning)'  is  created  and  managed  at  GPO  level  for Common Categories and at each Entity level for Entity-Specific Categories. A Sourcing Specialist/Lead is assigned as the 'Project Owner' of the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'.

## 2.2.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

## 2.2.3.(I) Prepare and Approve 'Category Strategy'

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

Category Management is a strategic approach to procurement. It encourages management of the procurement spend in groups of similar or related goods/services/projects, leading to consolidation and optimization opportunities. The advantages of Category Management include (but not limited to):

- 1) A deeper understanding of market, products, suppliers and the supply chain
- 2) Increased savings
- 3) Improvement in service levels, quality, availability and value for money
- 4) Enhanced Supplier relationships (higher Supplier performance)
- 5) Reduced supply chain risks

<!-- image -->

Below is an illustration of the cycle of Category Management:

Execute and Monitor 'Category Strategy'

## Prepare and Approve 'Category Startegy'

Figure 2.2.3 Category Management Cycle

<!-- image -->

A  'Category  Strategy'  is  created  for  each  Common  Category,  and  each  Entity-Specific  Category contributing to the top 80% of the Entity spend.

The  purpose  of  this  process  is  to  create  and  obtain  approvals  for  a  'Category  Strategy'  in  the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'.

Figure 2.2.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Prepare and Approve 'Category Strategy'

<!-- image -->

## 1) Create 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead can create a 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' by selecting 'Knowledge Project' from the 'SAP Ariba Dashboard', filling the 'Overview Form', and selecting the 'Category Management Template'.

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead provides UNSPSC Level 2 category in the 'Commodity' field in the 'Overview Form'.

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may link the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'  to  a  previously  executed  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  by selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  in  the  'Overview  Form'.  This  helps  in  indicating  the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In case, the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' created is identical (or similar) to a previously  executed  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)',  the  assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may  use  the  'Copy  from  Project'  field  to  readily  import  (but  not  limited  to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'.

The 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' gets activated when the 'Overview Form' is completed and submitted by the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead . This Sourcing Specialist/Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project.

## 2) Assign Procurement Manager

The 'Project Owner' assigns a Procurement Manager in  the  'Teams'  tab.  The Procurement Manager is  responsible  for  providing  oversight  of  the  Category  Management  processes  and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

## 3) Conduct Category Analysis

Category Analysis consists of two parts:

## a. Internal Category Profile

The 'Internal Category Profile' includes key learnings from spend analysis of the category. It includes details such as (but not limited to) category description, annual spend and volume, Supplier base, top 10 Suppliers by spend, and spend by sub-category.  Each detail provided in the 'Internal Category Profile' must be supported by relevant analysis.

The  'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  contains  an 'Internal Category Profile' document which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:

<!-- image -->

| Tab Name                     | Description                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Internal Category Profile | To record results of key analysis done for the category.                                               |
| 2. Typical Data Analysis     | Provides a list of spend data analyses that can be conducted to develop an 'Internal Category Profile' |

## Table 2.2.1 'Internal Category Profile' document structure

The  'Project  Owner'  may  use  the  'Internal  Category  Profile'  template  provided  in  the 'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  or  other  approved  template  covering  the required elements.

## b. External Market Analysis

'External Market Analysis' includes details of the industry structure and Supplier market for the category. It includes details such as (but not limited to) category tree and classification, value chain, demand drivers, supply market analysis, cost structure, and Supplier landscape. Various information sources can be used to develop an 'External Market Analysis'. These sources may include (but not limited to):

## b1. Primary Sources

- b11. End-Users and buyers of goods/services/projects
- b12. Suppliers and industry associations

## b2. Secondary Sources

- b21. Internet searches and company-specific publications
- b22. Online databases and media sources
- b23. Specialist public sector organisations
- b24. Private-sector research organisations

It is suggested that publicly available secondary sources are researched before conducting primary research. The 'Project Owner' should only explore paid market research reports only if publicly available secondary resources and primary sources are not sufficient.

The  'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  contains  an 'External Market Profile' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:

<!-- image -->

| Tab Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Table 2.2.3 'Category Strategy' document structure

The creation of the 'Category Strategy' consists of following activities:

## a. Step 1 - Undertake Category Segmentation

Category Segmentation depends on the following criteria:

- a1. Criticality of the Category is determined by factors such as (but not limited to) impact on Entity's operations in case of unavailability, and critical factors such as Health, Safety and Environment.
- a2. Complexity of the Category defines the inherent nature of a category that is governed by several factors including (but not limited to) availability of Suppliers, market structure (monopolistic, oligopolistic, competitive etc.), ability to switch Suppliers ,  possibility of substitution, lead times and regulations governing the category.

Based on above parameters, the category may be classified into the following segments:

Figure 2.2.5 Category Segmentation

<!-- image -->

## b. Step 2 - Identify and shortlist Strategic Levers

Based on the Category Segmentation, the 'Project Owner' selects the category optimization and improvement strategies (and associated levers). These strategies (and associated levers) are divided into following areas:

<!-- image -->

- b1. Usage and Innovation - refers to opportunities to increase efficiency and innovate by managing  demand,  optimizing  design  specifications,  and  collaborating  with  strategic Suppliers .
- b2. Price - refers to opportunities to reduce purchase price of goods/services/projects by utilizing advanced cost management, leveraging supply competition, and encouraging Supplier value creation.
- b3. Process and Operational Efficiency - refers to opportunities to improve key operational processes throughout the supply chain by improving transaction processing, managing costs, and increasing integration.
- b4. Risk and Sustainability - refers to opportunities to increase predictability and minimize environmental impact by implementing sustainable buying and leveraging risk management practices.

Details  of  the  strategies  (and  associated  levers)  within  each  of  the  following  areas  are provided in the 'Strategy X Levers' tab of the 'Category Strategy' document explained in Table 2.2.3 .

## c. Step 3 - Finalize Initiatives and Execution Plan

The 'Project Owner' identifies initiatives against various strategic levers and develops an 'Execution Plan' for each identified initiative.

## d. Step 4 - Develop Engagement Model with the Supplier

Based on the category value chain identified during the 'External Market Analysis' ( Table 2.2.2),  the  'Project  Owner'  determines  the  engagement  model. The  engagement model suggests the level at which the Supplier should be engaged as illustrated below:

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.2.6 Engagement levels

## e. Step 5 - Develop Business Case

The 'Project Owner' develops a business case at the category/sub-category level. Business case  provides  a  quantitative  estimate  of  the  potential  savings  that  can  be  achieved  by executing all selected initiatives within a category/sub-category. The 'Project Owner' may upload additional documents to support the business case calculations.

## 5) Review 'Category Strategy'

The  'Project  Owner'  uploads  the  completed  'Category  Strategy'  in  the  'Category  Strategy' folder in 'Documents" tab of the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' for review by the 'Reviewers' as per the PDoA .

<!-- image -->

The 'Reviewers' may consider  (but  not  limited  to)  the  following  points  while  reviewing  the 'Category Strategy':

- a. The 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' must address the relevant questions required to choose the strategic levers and initiatives for the category.
- b. The  strategic  levers  and  initiatives  identified  for  the  category  are  aligned  with  the 'Procurement Strategy'.
- c. The business case should be realistic and supported with suitable analysis.

The 'Reviewer' clicks on 'Complete Review' and, if required, attaches the modified 'Category Strategy'.  When  the  'Project  Owner'  receives  the  updated  'Category  Strategy'  from  the 'Reviewer', the 'Project Owner' may 'Accept All changes' or initiate another round of review. The latest version of the 'Category Strategy' gets saved in the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' (automatically) when the 'Project Owner' clicks on 'Accept All changes'.

## 6) Obtain approval for the 'Category Strategy'

The 'Project Owner' uploads the reviewed 'Category Strategy', in the 'Category Strategy' folder in 'Documents" tab, for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA .

- If  'Approvers'  reject  the  'Category  Strategy',  they  must  provide  a  valid  justification  to  the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Category Strategy', in the 'Category Strategy' folder in 'Documents" tab, for approval.

In case the modified 'Category Strategy' requires review by the 'Reviewers', the 'Project Owner' may re-trigger the 'Review' task. Otherwise, the 'Project Owner' can re-trigger the 'Approval' task for approval.

The  approved  'Category  Strategy'  is  shared  with  the  relevant Sourcing  Specialists/  Leads, Contracting Specialists/Leads , and SRM Specialists outside 'SAP Ariba'.

Monitor 'Category Strategy' execution

Close 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'

## Figure 2.2.8 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Execute and Monitor 'Category Strategy'

## 1) Monitor 'Category Strategy' execution

The  'Project  Owner'  conducts  periodic  reviews  of  the  'Category  Strategy'  execution.  These reviews are managed entirely outside 'SAP Ariba'.

The 'Project Owner' downloads the 'Category Strategy Progress Report' document from the 'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  and  share  it  with individuals identified to execute the 'Category Strategy' initiatives outside 'SAP Ariba'.

With each review, these individuals provide the updated status of the respective initiatives along with identified risks. The 'Project Owner' collates these inputs and uploads an updated version of the 'Category Strategy Progress Report' document in the 'Documents' tab of the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'.

The 'Project Owner' can modify the 'Category Strategy' during the execution if required. Any modification made to the 'Category Strategy' requires reviews and approvals, as explained in section 2.2.3.(I ).

## 2) Close 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)'

The  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  is  considered  completed  in  following scenarios:

- a. All initiatives identified in the 'Category Strategy' are executed.
- b. The Category Management cycle has been completed and a new 'Category Strategy' needs to be created.

In  either  case,  the  'Project  Owner'  uploads  the  updated  version  of  the  'Category  Strategy Progress Report' document in the 'Documents' tab and closes the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' by marking the 'Project State' field as 'Completed' in the 'Overview' tab.

The  closure  of  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Category  Management)'  is  communicated  to  the relevant individuals outside 'SAP Ariba'.

<!-- image -->

Create and Publish 'Demand Plan Input Collection Survey'

Collate survey responses and prepare 'Procurement Plan'

Assign 'Team Members'

Respond to the 'Demand Plan Input Collection Survey' (Survey Participants)

## Figure 2.2.10 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Prepare 'Procurement Plan'

## 1) Create 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead can create a 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'  by  selecting  the  'Knowledge  Project'  from  'SAP  Ariba  Dashboard',  filling  the 'Overview Form', and selecting the 'Procurement Demand Planning Template'.

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may link the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' by selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  field  in  the  'Overview  Form'. This  helps  in  indicating  the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In case, the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)', the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to)  'Overview  Form'  details,  and  if  required,  'Project  Groups'  and  documents  from  the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'.

The 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' gets activated when the 'Overview Form'  is  completed  and  submitted  by  the  assigned Sourcing  Specialist/Lead .  This Sourcing Specialist/Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project.

## 2) Assign 'Team Members'

'Team Members' are grouped into:

## a. 'Project Groups'

The  'Project  Groups'  enabled  within  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Procurement  Demand Planning)' are:

## a1. Project Owner

The 'Project Owner' is responsible for executing the tasks in the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'.

<!-- image -->

## a2. Procurement Manager

'Project Owner'  assigns the Procurement  Manager in the  'Teams' tab.  The Procurement  Manager is  responsible  for  providing  oversight  of  the  Procurement Planning processes and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

## a3. Finance

A representative from the Finance is  added to the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand  Planning)'  to  review  the  'Procurement  Plan'  and  validate  the  budget availability.

## b. 'System Groups'

'System  Groups'  are  groups  of  participants  pre-determined  for  a  'Knowledge  Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' (e.g., 'Approvers' and 'Reviewers'). The 'Project Owner' can add members to the 'System Groups' but cannot modify the existing members.

## 3) Create and Publish 'Demand Plan Input Collection Survey'

The  'Project  Owner'  sets  up  the  'Demand  Plan  Input  Collection  Survey'  by  finalizing  the following components:

## a. Survey Rules

This component specifies the rules for the execution of the survey, such as:

- a1. Timing Rules - defines time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

## b. Survey Participants

The Budget Owners are added as survey participants.

## c. Survey Content

The 'Demand Plan Input Collection Survey' content includes a 'Demand Gathering Form' document, which must be filled by all survey participants.

'Demand Gathering Form' document is designed to collate the demand requirements from various Entities, or various departments within an Entity, and assess the existing demandsupply  gap.  The  procurement  activities  for  the  coming  year  are  planned  to  bridge  this demand-supply gap identified in the document.

<!-- image -->

## Below is the structure of the document:

| Tab Name                 | Description                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Demand Gathering Form | To gather demand requirement from various departments / Entities (in case of GPO)                  |
| 2. Category Taxonomy     | Reference tab; to be referred to while filling level 2 category in the 'Demand Gathering Form' tab |

## Table 2.2.6 'Demand Gathering Form' document structure

## 4) Respond to the 'Demand Plan Input Collection Survey'

The Budget  Owners collate  the  demand  requirements  in  the  'Demand  Gathering  Form' document and validate the budget availability of the same. In case the budget is not available for the  collated  demand, the Budget Owner may arrange for additional budget or decrease the demand requirements accordingly.

## 5) Collate survey responses and prepare 'Procurement Plan'

The 'Documents' tab of the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' contains a 'Procurement Plan'  document,  which  may  be  downloaded,  completed,  and  uploaded  by  the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:

Table 2.2.7 'Procurement Plan' document structure

Below is an illustration summarizing the process of 'Procurement Plan' creation:

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.2.11 Procurement Plan creation

The  'Project  Owner'  may  consider  (but  not  limited  to)  following  points  while  creating  the 'Procurement Plan':

- a. Download and collate various 'Demand Plan Input Collection Survey' responses to complete the 'Demand and Supply Analysis' tab of the 'Procurement Plan'.
- b. Indicate details such as (but not limited to) sufficiency of the existing contract to fulfil the demand,  procurement  cycle  duration,  category  mapping,  and  priority  of  the  sourcing initiative in the 'Demand and Supply Analysis' tab of the 'Procurement Plan'.
- c. Use the sourcing and procurement initiatives identified in the various 'Category Strategy' documents to complete the 'Initiative Pipeline' tab of the 'Procurement Plan'.
- d. The  sourcing  initiatives  identified  in  the  'Demand  and  Supply  Analysis'  and  'Initiative Pipeline' tabs flow through to the 'Procurement Plan' tab, with respective priority.
- e. The 'Procurement Plan' tab of the document acts as one of the triggers for the creation of a 'Sourcing Request'. The information provided in the 'Procurement Plan' is used to complete the 'Overview Form' of the 'Sourcing Request'.

The demand requirements are collated across departments to identify overall demand for an Entity-Specific Category. The demand requirements are collated across Entities to identify overall demand for a Common Category.

The  completed  'Procurement  Plan'  is  uploaded  in  the  'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' for reviews and approvals.

## 2.2.3.(IV) Review and Approve 'Procurement Plan'

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The  purpose  of  this  process  is  to  obtain  reviews  and  approvals  for  the  'Procurement  Plan'.  The process applies to all prepared 'Procurement Plans'.

<!-- image -->

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.2.13 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Review and Approve 'Procurement Plan'

## 1) Review 'Procurement Plan'

The completed 'Procurement Plan' is reviewed by the 'Reviewers' designated as per the PDoA. The  'Reviewer'  clicks on 'Complete  Review'  and,  if required, attaches the  modified 'Procurement Plan'.

When the 'Project Owner' receives the reviewed 'Procurement Plan' from the 'Reviewer', the 'Project Owner' may 'Accept All changes' or initiate another round of review. The latest version of  the  'Procurement gets saved in the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' (automatically) when the 'Project Owner' clicks on 'Accept All changes'.

## 2) Obtain approvals for the 'Procurement Plan'

The reviewed 'Procurement Plan' is approved by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . If 'Approvers' recommend modifications to the 'Procurement Plan', the 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and uploads the updated version of the 'Procurement Plan' in the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'.

In  case  the  modified  'Procurement  Plan'  requires  review  by  the  'Reviewers',  the  'Project Owner' may re-trigger the 'Review' task. Otherwise, the 'Project Owner' can re-trigger the 'Approval' task for approval.

The  approved  'Procurement  Plan'  is  shared  with  the  relevant Sourcing  Specialists/  Leads, Contracting Specialists/Leads , and SRM Specialists outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities

The purpose of this process is to execute and close the approved 'Procurement Plan'. This process applies to all approved 'Procurement Plans'.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Figure 2.2.15 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Execute and Monitor 'Procurement Plan'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 1) Monitor progress against 'Procurement Plan'

The  sourcing  initiatives  identified  in  the  'Procurement  Plan'  are  executed  through  the  S2C processes. The 'Project Owner' of the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' conducts periodic reviews of the 'Procurement Plan' execution. This review is managed entirely outside 'SAP Ariba'.

With  each  review,  the  individuals  executing  the  identified  sourcing  initiatives  provide  the updated  status  along  with  identified  risks.  The  'Project  Owner'  collates  these  inputs  in  the 'Procurement  Plan'  document.  The  'Project  Owner'  uploads  an  updated  version  of  the 'Procurement Plan' document in the 'Documents' tab of the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'.

The 'Project Owner' can modify the 'Procurement Plan' document during the execution due to any adhoc demands, delays in execution, changes in the 'Category Strategy', or changes in the 'Procurement Strategy'. Any modification made to the 'Procurement Plan' requires reviews and approvals, as explained in section 2.2.3.(IV)

## 2) Close 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)'

The 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' is considered 'Complete' when the sourcing initiatives identified in the 'Procurement Plan' are executed.

The 'Project Owner' uploads an updated version of the 'Procurement Plan' document and closes the 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' project by marking the 'Project State' field as 'Completed' in the 'Overview' tab.

The  'Project  Owner'  communicates  the  closure  of  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Procurement Demand Planning)' to the respective stakeholders, outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## 2.3 Source to Contract (S2C)

## 2.3.1 Overview

The Source to Contract (S2C) process group consists of procedures for conducting sourcing with a focus on maximizing value, minimizing risk, and fulfilling the requirements for goods/services/projects in compliance with Procurement Standards.

This  section  explains  the  activities,  decisions  involved,  documents  used,  outcomes,  and  the stakeholders involved in the S2C processes.  Below is an illustration of the S2C Level 3 processes:

The S2C process group requires cross-functional collaboration and an appropriate level of governance for decision making and approvals.

Below is an illustration of the guidelines provided in the PDoA to enable decision making for the S2C processes:

Figure 2.3.2 PDoA guidelines for decision making - S2C processes

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Important  Note:  The  guidelines  illustrated  above  are  not  enforced  by  'SAP  Ariba'.  The Procurement must comply with these guidelines in adherence with the Procurement Standards and the PDoA.

Important  Note:  All  exceptions  to  the  authorizations  mandated  in  the  PDoA  are  to  be supplemented with documentary justifications and require approval from relevant authorities.

## 2.3.2 'SAP Ariba Module' Overview

All S2C processes are enabled via the "SAP Ariba Sourcing module" as illustrated:

## Figure 2.3.3 S2C processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages

- A 'Sourcing Request' initiates the process to identify the Supplier for required goods/services/projects. It may be created against either an approved 'Purchase Requisition (PR)' or a sourcing initiative in the approved 'Procurement Plan'. An approved 'Sourcing Request' leads to a 'Sourcing Project'.
- A 'Sourcing Project' enables execution of all tendering related tasks including (but not limited to) creation  of  a  'Sourcing  Strategy',  creation,  execution,  and  evaluation  of  the  Sourcing  Event,  and preparation  of  'Award  Recommendation  Report'.  A  'Sourcing  Project'  may  include  one  or  more Sourcing Events.

The Sourcing Event enables interaction between Procurement and Suppliers to obtain information or bids. Following are the types of Sourcing Events:

1. Request for Information (RFI)
2. Request for Proposal (RFP)
3. Request for Quotation (RFQ)
4. Reverse Auctions (eAuctions)

A Sourcing Specialist/Lead is assigned as the "Project Owner" of the 'Sourcing Project' in 'SAP Ariba'. This assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead creates the 'Sourcing Request' against which the 'Sourcing Project' is created and executed. In case of an Entity Specific Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the Entity managing the category while in case of a Common Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the GPO.

## 2.3.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

## 2.3.3.(I) Prepare and Approve 'Sourcing Request (SR)'

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

Creation and approval of a 'Sourcing Request (SR)' is mandatory to conduct sourcing in 'SAP Ariba'. The purpose of this process is to create and obtain approval for the SR.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

Figure 2.3.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Prepare and Approve 'Sourcing Request'

<!-- image -->

## 1) Create SR

An SR may be created in following ways:

- a. Flip an approved PR into an SR (linking 'ORACLE ADERP' and 'SAP Ariba')

Figure 2.3.5 Procurement processes across 'ORACLE ADERP' and 'SAP Ariba'

<!-- image -->

If  the  goods/services/projects  requested  in  an  approved PR  require sourcing, PR may  be flipped  into  an  SR  to  identify  and  finalize  the Supplier .  Since  PR  is  created  in  'ORACLE ADERP', it must be flipped into an SR manually, as following:

- a1. The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead creates an SR in the 'Sourcing Module' against an approved PR.
- a2. Details of the approved PRs are downloaded from 'ORACLE ADERP' and added in the SR. Additional details may be added as an attachment in the SR for review and approval.
- a3. Multiple PRs may be aggregated into a Single  SR,  or  a  single  PR  may  be  split  across multiple SRs, as required.

Important  Note:  Approved  PR  is  verified  by  the  Procurement  against  existing  contracts  and inventories to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations.

Important Note: The approved procurement requirement is not to be split into multiple SR  to bypass  approval  authorities.  Any  split  must  be  documented  and  approved  by  the  Head  of Procurement.

- b. Create SR against sourcing initiatives in the approved 'Procurement Plan'

The  assigned Sourcing  Specialist/Lead can create  an  SR  based  on  a  sourcing  initiative identified in the 'Procurement Plan' and provide required details.

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead can create an SR by selecting 'Sourcing Request' from the 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' and completing the 'Overview Form'.

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead provides UNSPSC Level 2 category in the 'Commodity' field in the 'Overview Form'.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The  assigned Sourcing  Specialist/Lead may  link  the  'Sourcing  Request'  to  a  previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' or 'Sourcing Request' by selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  in  the  'Overview  Form'.  This  helps  in  indicating  the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In  case,  the  'Sourcing  Request'  created  is  identical  (or  similar)  to  a  previously  executed 'Sourcing Request' the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Sourcing Request'.

The  assigned Sourcing  Specialist/Lead specifies  the  'Sourcing  Method'  in  the  'Overview Form'.

## 2) Select the 'Sourcing Method'

The 'Project Owner' selects the type of the 'Sourcing Method' to be used for the 'Sourcing Project'. Following are the types of 'Sourcing Methods' available:

| Aspects              | Public Tender                                                                                                                  | Limited Tender                                                                                                                 | Sole/Single Source                                                                                                             |

## Table 2.3.1 Summary of features - Sourcing Methods

Important Note: Interested Suppliers, that are not registered in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the DGS, may participate in Public Tenders. However, they must be registered in the 'SAP Ariba Network'.

Important Note: Sole/Single source should only be selected as the last option, and Procurement must endeavor to suggest suitable alternatives wherever possible.

In  case  the  assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead selects  the  Single/Sole  source  as  the  'Sourcing Method' or  deviates  from  the  'Sourcing  Method'  prescribed  in  the  PDoA,  the  rationale  and business case for the same must be provided for approval. Recommended Sourcing Method, in relation to the tender value, have been specified in the PDoA .

<!-- image -->

The  SR  gets  activated  once  the  'Overview  Form'  is  submitted  by  the  assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead . This assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the SR automatically.

## 3) Add Procurement Manager

The  'Project  Owner'  assigns  the Procurement  Manager .  The Procurement  Manager is responsible for providing oversight of the S2C processes and ensure execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

## 4) Add SR Line Items/additional documents

The 'Project Owner' edits the SR attributes and provide line-item details. If the SR has been created from an approved PR, this information is imported from the PR. The 'Project Owner' may submit additional documents (e.g., SOW) with the SR for review and approval.

## 5) Obtain all approvals for SR

The completed SR is reviewed and approved by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . 'Approval' tasks are initiated automatically in 'Sourcing Module' once all predecessor tasks are 'Completed'.

If 'Approvers' reject the SR, they must provide a valid justification to the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the SR for approval.

Once the SR is approved, a 'Sourcing Project' template appears in the 'Documents' tab of the SR,  automatically.  This  template  is then  used  to  execute  and manage the  'Sourcing Project' associated with the approved SR.

Figure 2.3.7 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Create 'Sourcing Project'

## 1) Create 'Sourcing Project'

As indicated in the previous process, a 'Sourcing Project' template appears in the 'Documents' tab of the SR, once the SR is approved. The 'Project Owner' uses this template and completes the 'Overview Form' to create the 'Sourcing Project'.

Additional  'Sourcing  Projects'  may  be  created  against  an  SR  by  using  the  'Subproject' functionality available in the 'Documents' tab.

The 'Project Owner' provides the UNSPSC Level 2 category in the 'Commodity' field and specifies the 'Project Type' and 'Event type' in the 'Overview Form'.

<!-- image -->

## 2) Select the 'Project Type'

Following are the 'Project Types' available in 'SAP Ariba':

- a. 'Full Sourcing Project' is the preferred choice for a high spend - strategic sourcing initiatives which  may  require  a  'Sourcing  Strategy',  multiple  Sourcing  Events,  and  technical  and commercial bid submission in separate 'Envelopes'.

## Important Note: Public Tenders can only be executed using 'Full Sourcing Projects'.

- b. 'Quick Sourcing Project' is  the  preferred choice for a low spend - non-strategic sourcing Initiatives  which  may  not  require  a  'Sourcing  Strategy'  or  multiple  Sourcing  Events,  and where bids may be submitted in a single 'Envelope'.

Below is an illustration of the differences between a 'Full Sourcing Project' and a 'Quick Sourcing Project':

## Figure 2.3.8 'Sourcing Project' types in 'SAP Ariba'

Process flows for a 'Full Sourcing Project' (strategic sourcing initiative) and a 'Quick Sourcing Project' (non-strategic sourcing initiative) are illustrated below:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.3.9 'Full Sourcing Project' process flow

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.3.10 'Quick Sourcing Project' process flow

Single  or  multiple  'Sourcing  Projects'  can  be  created  against  an  approved  SR.  The  'Project Owner' has an option to select a different 'Sourcing Method' for each 'Sourcing Project' within SR.

The  Procurement  Manual,  by  default,  covers  S2C  processes  from  a  'Full  Sourcing  Project' perspective. In case a process is not applicable (or is different) for a 'Quick Sourcing Project', it has been highlighted in the respective section.

Recommended 'Project Types', in relation to the tender value, have been illustrated in Figure 2.3.2. Any deviation from the recommended 'Project Types' must be accompanied by a valid justification and should be approved by relevant authorities as per the PDoA .

<!-- image -->

## 3) Select the 'Event Type'

Following are the 'Event Types' enabled in "SAP Ariba":

## a. Request for Information (RFI)

Used to gather information (market/spend/ Supplier base) or to shortlist Suppliers for RFP/ RFQ.

## b. Request for Proposal (RFP)

Used  for  seeking  proposals  from Suppliers ;  best  suited  for  services  or  cases  where  the Procurement relies on the experience and creativity of Suppliers to define the best solution. RFP may be followed by RFQ or negotiations.

## c. Request for Quotation (RFQ)

Used for seeking pricing information for a well-defined scope of work or supply of specified goods/services/projects, usually preferred for commoditized goods/services/projects where substitutes/ alternatives are allowed.

## d. Reverse Auction (eAuction)

Used  as  an  alternative  to  the  RFQ  for  highly  commoditized  goods/services,  or  where participating Suppliers have fully acknowledged specifications (substitutes/alternatives not allowed);  usually  multiple Suppliers are  invited  to  participate  in  eAuctions  to  maximize savings. During eAuctions, the Suppliers can see their relative ranking and can adjust their bids in real-time.

Important Note: The 'Project Owner' may select multiple Sourcing Events within a 'Full Sourcing Project,' depending on the requirement. However, only one Sourcing Event per 'Event Type' can be executed within a 'Full Sourcing Project' (e.g., 2 RFPs or 2 RFQs are not allowed).

Important  Note:  The  'Project  Owner'  cannot  run  parallel  Sourcing  Events  within  a  'Sourcing Project'. There must only be a single 'Award Scenario' per 'Sourcing Project'.

Important Note: The 'Project Owner' may keep an additional Sourcing Event (RFP/RFQ) in the 'Sourcing Project' to obtain and record post-negotiation responses from the Suppliers, if required.

The 'Project Owner' may link the 'Sourcing Project' to a previously executed 'Sourcing Project'  by  selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  in  the  'Overview  Form'.  This  helps  in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In  case,  the  'Sourcing  Project'  created  is  identical  (or  similar)  to  a  previously  executed 'Sourcing Project', the  'Project Owner' may use the 'Copy from Project' field to  readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Sourcing Project'.

Important Note: Only a 'Full Sourcing Project' can be copied to another 'Full Sourcing Project'. The same is the case for a 'Quick Sourcing Project'.

<!-- image -->

Once the 'Overview Form' is completed and submitted by the 'Project Owner', in case of a 'Full Sourcing project', the 'Sourcing Project' gets activated and in case of a 'Quick Sourcing Project', the 'Project Owner' is directed to the 'Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event' process directly.

## 4) Assign 'Team Members'

The 'Team Members' are grouped into:

## a. 'Project Groups'

The 'Project Groups' enabled within 'Sourcing module' are:

## a1. 'Project Owner'

The 'Project Owner' is responsible for the execution of 'Sourcing Project' tasks.

## a2. 'Contract Manager' (not enabled in the 'Quick Sourcing Projects')

The Contract  Specialist/Lead assigned  as  the  'Contract  Manager'  is  responsible  for creating,  updating,  and  maintaining  contract  templates  for  goods/services/projects associated with the 'Sourcing Project'.

## a3. Procurement Manager

Procurement Manager is responsible for providing oversight of the S2C processes and ensures the execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

## a4. 'Project Observers'

'Project Observers' are responsible for only observing the progress of the 'Sourcing Project'. Participants of this group are pre-determined. The 'Project Owner' can add members to this group but cannot modify the existing members.

## a5. 'Team Graders' (not enabled in the 'Quick Sourcing Projects')

'Team Graders' are responsible for performing technical evaluations and commercial evaluations  (if  required)  of  the Supplier responses  to  the  Sourcing  Event.  They  may participate  in  negotiations,  review  the  'Sourcing  Strategy',  and  provide  inputs  to  the 'Negotiations Plan' and 'Award Recommendation Report'.

In case the Tendering Committee is mandated by the PDoA (please refer to Figure 2.3.2), members  of  the Tendering  Committee are  added  as  'Team  Graders'.  In  case  the Tendering Committee is not mandated, the 'Project Owner' may add individuals from other functions and the Procurement as 'Team Graders'.

Important  Note:  Members  of  the  Tendering  Committee  are  nominated  by  the  respective department  heads  and  endorsed  by  the  Head  of  Procurement.  This  endorsement  is  managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.

<!-- image -->

The 'Project Owner' can download the 'Tendering Committee Creation Form' document from the 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' to confirm the Tendering Committee members.  The  'Project  Owner'  uploads  the  completed  'Tendering  Committee  Creation Form' document in the 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project'.

For Entity-Specific Category, members of 'Project Groups' are from the Entity managing the category.  In  the  case  of  a  Common  Category,  the  'Project  Owner'  is  from  the  GPO,  while stakeholders from other Entities may be assigned as 'Team Graders' if required.

## b. 'System Groups'

'System Groups' are groups of participants pre-determined for a 'Sourcing Project' (e.g., 'Approvers'  and  'Reviewers').  The  'Project  Owner'  can  add  members  to  the  'System Groups' but cannot modify the existing members.

Important Note: Assigning 'Team Members' is the first task within a 'Full Sourcing Project'. For a 'Quick Sourcing Project', the 'Team Members' are assigned within the Sourcing Event.

## Figure 2.3.12 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Develop and Approve 'Sourcing Strategy'

## 1) Prepare 'Sourcing Strategy'

The 'Sourcing Strategy' contains necessary information to design and execute a 'Full Sourcing Project' in line with the End-User requirements and the Procurement Standards. It includes (but not limited to) objectives, timelines, key milestones, Supplier long list, and RACI matrix for the Sourcing Events planned.

The 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' contains a 'Sourcing Strategy' document which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:

| Tab Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Internal Category Profile  | To conduct detailed level assessment of internal trends, market opportunities, risks and supplier base,                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2. External Category Analysis | To conduct detailed level assessment of internal trends, market opportunities, risks and supplier base,                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3.Sourcing                    | Strategy To select a Sourcing Method and determine the appropriate solicitation channel based on the objectives of sourcing activity.                                                                                                                                           |
| 4. Project Plan               | To develop a detailed plan for Sourcing Event including milestones, timelines and involved stakeholders                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5. RACI                       | To describes the level and nature of participation by various stakeholders for completing the activities planned for the Sourcing Event. RACI is an acronym derived from the four key responsibilities most typically used: responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed . |

Table 2.3.4 'Sourcing Strategy' document structure

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Sourcing Strategy' template provided in the 'Sourcing Project' or other approved template covering the required elements.

The 'Project Owner' considers the following points while creating the 'Sourcing Strategy':

- a. Complete all the 'Sourcing Strategy' sections mentioned above, in collaboration with the End-User, the Tendering Committee, and the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) , as required .
- b. In case the 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' are available in the 'Category  Strategy'  document,  the  "Project  Owner"  is  advised  to  use  them  to  complete respective sections of the 'Souring Strategy'.
- c. In  case  the  'Internal  Category  Profile'  and  'External  Category  Analysis'  are  not  available, create these sections using the methods explained in section 2.2.3.(I)ii.3).
- d. In the absence of required information, conduct RFI event and/or market research activities to create the 'Sourcing Strategy'.
- e. Indicate the Sourcing Method and Sourcing Event type in the 'Sourcing Strategy' in line with details  provided  in  the  'Overview  Form'  explained  in section  2.3.3.(I)ii.2) and section 2.3.3.(II)ii.3) .
- f. The  Supplier  Long  List  section  of  the  'Sourcing  Strategy'  is  only  applicable  for  Limited Tenders. It must only include Suppliers from the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS.

## 2) Review 'Sourcing Strategy'

The 'Project Owner' uploads the completed 'Sourcing Strategy' in the 'Documents" tab of the 'Sourcing Project' for review by the 'Team Graders' . 'Review' tasks are initiated automatically in 'Sourcing Module' once all predecessor tasks are 'Completed'.

The 'Team Graders' may recommend modifications to the 'Sourcing Strategy' or even upload an updated version of the 'Sourcing Strategy', post review.

The 'Team Graders' clicks on 'Complete Review' and if required, attach the modified 'Sourcing Strategy'. When the 'Project Owner' receives the updated 'Sourcing Strategy' from the 'Team Graders', the 'Project Owner' may 'Accept All changes' or initiate another round of review. The latest version of the 'Sourcing Strategy' gets saved in the 'Documents' tab of the  'Sourcing Project' (automatically) when the 'Project Owner' clicks on 'Accept All changes'.

## 3) Obtain approvals for the 'Sourcing Strategy'

The 'Sourcing Strategy' is approved by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . 'Approval' tasks are initiated automatically in  'Sourcing Module'  once  all  predecessor  tasks  are 'Completed'.

If  'Approvers'  reject  the  'Sourcing  Strategy',  they  must  provide  a  valid  justification  to  the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Sourcing Strategy' for approval.

<!-- image -->

If the 'Approvers' approve the 'Sourcing Strategy', the 'Project Owner' proceeds to the next task.

The 'Project Owner' can modify an approved 'Sourcing Strategy' during the 'Sourcing Project' execution, with a valid rationale. Post any modification, the 'Sourcing Strategy' is reviewed and approved, as explained in previous steps.

The  'Project  Owner'  ensures  that  the  'Sourcing  Project'  is  executed  in  line  with  the  latest approved version of the 'Sourcing Strategy'.

## 4) Review and agree to Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest

Sourcing Events are activated in 'Full Sourcing Projects' only after the "Project Owner" reviews and agrees to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest.

In  case  the  'Project  Owner'  has  a  potential/actual  conflict  of  interest,  the  'Project  Owner' records the same in 'Comments' section of the task and informs the 'Supervisor'. The Head of Procurement appoints another 'Project Owner' in this case.

Figure 2.3.14 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event

## 1) Prepare and Publish the Sourcing Event

Please refer to 2.3.3.(II)ii.3) to review the types of Sourcing Events and how to select a Sourcing Event for a 'Sourcing Project'.

The 'Project Owner' creates the Sourcing Event by completing the following segments:

<!-- image -->

## a. Event Rules

This segment specifies the rules for the execution of the Sourcing Event which may include (but not limited to):

- a1. Timing Rules -  defines  time-related  parameters of the  Sourcing  Event (e.g.,  Planned Start date and time)
- a2. Bidding Rules -sets rules for bidding for the Sourcing Event (e.g., enable blind grading for the event)
- a3. Currency Rules sets rules related to the currency of bidding for Bidder(s) (e.g., should Suppliers be allowed to select bidding currency or should it be fixed to AED).

## b. Assign 'Team Members' (Quick Projects)

For 'Quick Sourcing Projects', the 'Team Members' are assigned within the Sourcing Event. Please refer to section 2.3.3. (II)-(ii)-2.3.3.(II)ii.4) for details of this process.

Important Note: 'Project Owner' and the Procurement Manager are the only 'Project Groups' enabled in 'Quick Sourcing Projects'.

## c. Select Suppliers

The  'Project  Owner'  considers  following  points  while  selecting Suppliers for  a  Sourcing Event:

- c1. Screen  and  shortlist Suppliers considering  the  criteria  laid  out  in  the  Procurement Standards,  which  may  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  financial  health,  commercial standing, legal standing, historical Supplier performance, and technical capabilities.
- c2. The shortlisting of Suppliers can be done via RFI, market research, or industry reports.
- c3. In  case  of  'Full  Sourcing  Project',  the  'Project  Owner'  shortlists Suppliers from  the Supplier Long List provided in the approved 'Sourcing Strategy'.
- c4. For  all  Limited  Tenders, Suppliers are  selected  from  the  Supplier  Master  Database maintained by the DGS.
- c5. Selecting Suppliers for the Sourcing Event does not apply to Public Tenders. All Public Tenders are published on 'SAP Ariba Discovery' and 'Abu Dhabi Procurements Portal'. All interested Suppliers can view and participate in Public Tenders provided they have an account on 'SAP Ariba Network".

Important Note: 'Project Owners' must select the Suppliers 'Registered' for the specific category for the Sourcing Event.

Important Note: Suppliers with 'Disqualified' status in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the DGS, are not to be invited to participate in a Limited Tender.

Important  Note:  The  Suppliers  need  not  be  'Registered'  in  the  Supplier  Master  Database maintained by the DGS to participate in Public Tenders.

Important Note: 'SAP Ariba Discovery' postings are created for all Public Tenders.

<!-- image -->

## d. Event Content

Includes  sections/questions/requirements  to  which  the Suppliers must  respond  to  be evaluated and awarded. The Sourcing Event content varies depending on the Sourcing Event type (RFI, RFP, RFQ, eAuctions).

Sourcing Event content consists of the following sections:

## d1. Pre-requisites

The  pre-requisites  provide  the  context  of  the  Sourcing  Event  to  the Suppliers .  They include the essential terms and conditions which the Suppliers must review and agree to before they are allowed to view and respond to the Sourcing Event. The pre-requisites may include (but not limited to):

- d11. Event Overview
- d12. Expression of Interest
- d13. Non-Disclosure Agreement

## d2. Main Content of the Event

The main content of the Sourcing Event consists of sections/questions/requirements to obtain Suppliers' responses. Sourcing Event content may include (but not limited to):

- d21. Event definitions, scope, terms, and conditions provide necessary information to participate in the Sourcing Event.
- d22. Bid  Bond ensures  that  the  awarded Suppliers fulfill  the  commitments  of  the accepted bid. It is only required for Sourcing Events, which may result in binding commercial proposals. The provisions of the Bid Bond with respect to the tender value  is illustrated in Figure 2.3.2 . Any  deviation  from  the  recommended provisions must be accompanied by a valid justification and should be approved by relevant authorities as per the PDoA .
- Please refer to section 1.5 to review the list of Suppliers exempted from the Bid Bond submission.
- d23. Draft  Contract is  the  agreement  proposed  to  be  finalized  and  signed,  post conclusion  of  the 'Sourcing  Project'  for Suppliers to  review  and  provide departures if required.
- d24. 'Technical Envelope' contains sections/questions/requirements to evaluate the technical capability of the Supplier to supply the required goods/services/projects.
- d25. 'Commercial Envelope' contains sections/questions/requirements for the Suppliers to  provide  commercial  bids.  In  case,  the  line  items  have  been  added

<!-- image -->

during 'Sourcing Request', they flow through to the 'Commercial Envelope' of the Sourcing Event. 'Commercial Envelope' include (but not limited to):

- I) Bid Sheets -The 'Project Owner' can create the commercial bid sheets in 'SAP Ariba' in the following ways:
2. (i) Create each line item in 'SAP Ariba'.
3. (ii) Upload the line item information using the 'SAP Ariba' preferred excel format.

In  this  case,  the  commercial  bids  are  provided,  monitored,  and  evaluated within 'SAP Ariba', using the 'Bid Console' functionality (e.g., eAuctions).

The 'Project Owner' may provide the commercial bid sheet in an excel format, which the Suppliers download, complete, and upload as part of the overall Sourcing Event response.

The "Project Owner', in collaboration with the End-User ,  may make all line items mandatory for Suppliers to respond.

Important Note: At least one-line item must be added directly in 'SAP Ariba' to enable awarding of the event. (e.g., In case the Bid sheet is provided in the form of an excel file, the line item added in 'SAP Ariba' can be the 'Total Cost' to which the Suppliers must respond).

Important Note: In the case of eAuctions, line items must be created in 'SAP Ariba' to enable the 'Bid Console' functionality.

Post finalizing the content of the Sourcing Event, the 'Project Owner' may add scoring criteria (weight/importance/target grade) to enable evaluation of the Sourcing Event within 'SAP Ariba'. In case the scoring criteria are not set up in 'SAP Ariba', the Sourcing Event can only be evaluated offline.

- II) ICV Question - As part of the 'Commercial Envelopes', the 'Project Owner' requests the Suppliers to provide the In-Country Value (ICV) Certificate in line with the Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC) program initiated by the Abu Dhabi Department  of  Economic  Development  (AD-DED).  Please  refer  to Error!  R eference source not found. Section 1.5.1 for the details of the ADLC program.

In  case  of  single-stage  evaluations  ('Quick  Projects'),  the  'Technical  Envelope'  and 'Commercial Envelope' are merged into a 'Technical and Commercial Envelope' with both aspects  being  recorded  and  evaluated  simultaneously.  The  'Technical  and  Commercial Envelope' can be imported from the 'Sourcing Library' provided in 'SAP Ariba'.

Important Note: Adding the 'Technical and Commercial Envelope' is mandatory for RFI and RFQ within a 'Quick Sourcing Project'.

<!-- image -->

The  "Project  Owner"  may  modify  the  "Pre-requisites',  "Main  Content',  and  "Scoring Methodology"  of  the  Sourcing  Event  as  required.  The  'Project  Owner'  may  make  a section/question within the Sourcing Event content mandatory for the Suppliers to respond. These sections/questions appear with a (*) mark in 'SAP Ariba'.

Important Note: 'SAP Ariba' allows for attachment of files up to 100MB (per file). In case, the "Project  Owner"  anticipates  the  Supplier  to  upload  attachments  above  this  limit,  the  "Project Owner" may split the sections/questions in 'Technical Envelope' or 'Commercial Envelope' (as required) to enable uploading of multiple smaller attachments.

## 2) Create draft 'Contract Workspace'

A  'Contract  Workspace'  may  be  created  from  within  the  'Sourcing  Project'  to  initiate  the internal review of the 'Main Contract Document' as explained in the section 2.3.3.(IV)-(ii)-2) .

## 3) Obtain approvals for the Sourcing Event

The completed Sourcing Event is submitted by the 'Project Owner' for approval by 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . 'Approval' tasks are initiated automatically in 'Sourcing Module' once all predecessor tasks are 'Completed'.

If 'Approvers' reject the Sourcing Event, they must provide a valid justification to the 'Project Owner'.  The  'Project  Owner'  makes  the  recommended  modifications  and  re-submits  the Sourcing Event for approval.

If  the  'Approvers'  approve  the  Sourcing  Event,  it  is  published  for  the Suppliers to  view  and respond.

## 2.3.3.(V) Execute and Monitor Sourcing Event

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The approved Sourcing Event is published to the Suppliers to provide responses. The purpose of this process is to monitor the Sourcing Event during execution and respond to Suppliers' queries.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Figure 2.3.16 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Execute and Monitor Sourcing Event

<!-- image -->

## 1) Monitor the acceptance of pre-requisites

Suppliers must accept the pre-requisites to access and respond to the Sourcing Event content. The  'Project  Owner'  is  informed  (via  email)  when  a Suppliers accepts  Sourcing  Event  prerequisites. The 'Project Owner' may monitor the same within the Sourcing Event.

## 2) Respond to Suppliers' queries/requests

While responding to the Sourcing Event, Suppliers may seek clarifications or ask for additional information  from  the  'Project  Owner'.  All  queries/requests  for  additional  information  by

<!-- image -->

Suppliers appear in the "Message" tab within the Sourcing Event. The "Message Board" acts as a two-way communication channel between Suppliers and "Project Owner" during the execution of the Sourcing Event.

Important Note: Responses provided by the 'Project Owner' are made available to all participating Suppliers to maintain transparency. The 'Project Owner' ensures that the identity of the Supplier seeking clarification is kept confidential. It is recommended to keep the "Message Board" open until awarding for the event is complete.

## 3) Modify Sourcing Event/ extend Sourcing Event timelines

If required, the 'Project Owner' may modify a Sourcing Event, provided modifications made are compliant  with  the  Procurement  Standards.  The  'Project  Owner'  cannot  invite  any  new Suppliers while modifying a published event.

Important Note: In case a new Supplier is to be added, the published event is cancelled, and another event published with the updated list of Suppliers identified for participation. This is considered a new Sourcing Event.

The 'Project Owner' may extend Sourcing Event timelines under the following scenarios:

- a. Modifications/additions have been made to the published Sourcing Event content, due to which Suppliers require additional time to respond to the event.
- b. Suppliers have requested additional time to respond to the published event;

There must be a valid justification for modifying a published Sourcing Event. This rationale is reviewed and approved by 'Approvers' as per the PDoA . Modifications made to the Sourcing Event must be uniform for all Suppliers .

## 4) Monitor the submission of Suppliers' responses

The Suppliers must respond to the Sourcing Event in line with the terms and conditions of the Sourcing Event. Suppliers can revise their submitted responses, as long as the Sourcing Event is active.  The 'Project Owner' can monitor the submission of Sourcing Event responses by the Suppliers within 'SAP Ariba'.

Important Note: The responses provided by the Suppliers can be viewed only after opening the respective 'Envelopes'.

<!-- image -->

Please refer to Appendix 3.1 - 2.3.3.(V) Execute and Monitor Sourcing Event for the process map.

## 2.3.3.(VI) Evaluate Sourcing Event

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The technical and commercial evaluations of a Souring Event are conducted in one of the following ways:

## 1) Single-Stage Evaluation

In a single-stage evaluation, the technical and commercial evaluation is conducted together in a single 'Envelope'. (e.g., RFQ within a 'Quick Sourcing Project'). Single-Stage evaluation may imply that only one of the evaluations is required.

## 2) Two-Stage Evaluation

In  a  two-stage  evaluation,  commercial  and  technical  evaluations  are  conducted  in  separate 'Envelopes'. In such cases, the commercial evaluations are conducted only for Suppliers that have qualified the technical evaluations. (e.g., RFP/RFQ within 'Full Sourcing Project')

Important  Note:  In  case  of  eAuctions,  the  'Bid  Console'  functionality  of  'SAP  Ariba'  can automatically  indicate  the  lowest  bid  for  all  line  items.  Further  evaluations  for  eAuctions,  if required, is conducted outside 'SAP Ariba'.

The purpose of the process is to conduct technical and commercial evaluations of Suppliers' responses, as required.

<!-- image -->

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Task

Figure 2.3.18 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Evaluate Sourcing Event

<!-- image -->

## 1) Open 'Technical Envelopes'

For 'Full Sourcing Projects', the 'Project Owner' opens the 'Technical Envelopes' for initiating the  technical  evaluations.  The  'Team  Graders'  receive  a  system-generated  email  when  the 'Technical Envelopes' are opened.

## 2) Review pre-requisites for evaluation

The 'Team Graders' must review and agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest before conducting the technical evaluation. These requirements are provided within the 'Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation' task description.

In case a "Team Grader" does not agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest, a valid reason for the same is provided to the "Project Owner' via the comments section in the task. The 'Team Grader' leaves the task un-attempted in this case.

In such cases, the "Team Grader" is replaced by the "Project Owner" upon recommendation of the respective function head. Replacement of the "Team Grader" is endorsed by the Head of Procurement , outside 'SAP Ariba'.

The Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest are deemed accepted (automatically) by the 'Team Graders' when they complete the 'Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation' task.

## 3) Conduct technical evaluations

Following methods are provided in 'SAP Ariba' to conduct technical evaluations:

- a. Grade by Content enables grading of each response, across Suppliers , within 'SAP Ariba'; this method may be used for comparative grading across Suppliers responses.
- b. Grade by Participants enables grading of responses, one Supplier at a time .
- c. Grade Offline Using Excel enables grading in an excel spreadsheet, outside 'SAP Ariba'

The  Technical  Evaluation  within  'Sourcing  Module'  is  based  on  the  'Scoring  Methodology' defined in the Sourcing Event.

Important Note: In case of  an  RFI  event,  the  Sourcing  Event  evaluation  may result  in  a  list  of 'Screened and Shortlisted Suppliers' for subsequent Sourcing Events.

<!-- image -->

## 4) Conduct commercial evaluations

In  case  of  a  two-stage  evaluation,  once  the  technical  evaluation  is  completed,  the  'Project Owner' opens the 'Commercial Envelopes' for technically qualified Suppliers . The commercial evaluation  is  conducted  by  the  'Project  Owner',  engaging  the End-user and  the Finance, if required.

The 'Project Owner' may engage the 'Team Graders' to conduct the commercial evaluation, when recommended by the PDoA.

## Important Note: In case of 'Quick Sourcing Project' the Sourcing Event evaluation is managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.

Depending upon whether negotiations are required or not, the Evaluate Sourcing Event process may either lead to Conduct Negotiation process or the Award and Event Close Out process.

## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities

<!-- image -->

Please refer to Appendix 3.1 - 2.3.3.(VI) Evaluate Sourcing Event for the process map .

## 2.3.3.(VII) Conduct Negotiations (optional process)

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The 'Project Owner' may conduct negotiations to realize additional value for the 'Sourcing Project'. Negotiations may not be required if the time and effort required to conduct negotiations outweigh the benefits of the same.

The 'Conduct Negotiations' task is only enabled in the 'Full Sourcing Project'. In case negotiations are required for a 'Quick Sourcing Project', they are managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.

Following (but not limited to) aspects of the Supplier's response may be negotiated:

- 1) Departures from the proposed contract
- 2) Commercial and Technical offer made by the Supplier

The purpose of this process is to conduct negotiations if required.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Figure 2.3.20 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Conduct Negotiations

<!-- image -->

## 1) Shortlist Suppliers for negotiations

The 'Project Owner' shortlists Suppliers for negotiations and create a 'Negotiations Bidders List Request' based on the technical and commercial evaluations.

## 2) Prepare 'Negotiation Plan'

The 'Project Owner', in collaboration with the End-User or Tendering Committee , develops a 'Negotiation Plan' to conduct negotiations. The 'Negotiation Plan' is a document detailing (but not  limited to)  the  purpose,  the  target,  and  the  proposed methodology  of  negotiations. The document provides details of the negotiation strategies that may be used.

The 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' contains a 'Negotiation Plan' document which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

| Section Name            | Description                                                                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Data Collation       | To create a Bid Summary for all the offers received from the shortlisted Bidders.       |
| 2. Defining Needs       | To provide a summary of the Entity and Bidder needs to be addressed during negotiation. |
| 3. Negotiation Case     | To document the most beneficial and achievable solution.                                |
| 4. Estimate proportions | To create a list of points of leverage to be used during negotiation.                   |
| 5. Planning             | To document the team and schedule of negotiation.                                       |
| 6. Results              | To summarize the negotiation outcomes.                                                  |

## Table 2.3.9 'Negotiation Plan' document sections

The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Negotiation Plan' template provided in the 'Sourcing Project' or other approved template covering the required elements.

The 'Project Owner' establishes a team to conduct negotiations. A 'Negotiations Team' may include  (but  not  limited  to)  Lead  Negotiator,  Summarizer,  Observer,  Minutes  Taker,  Subject Matter Expert, Financial Analyst, and Legal Advisor. The 'Negotiations Team' is encouraged to:

- a. Identify  the  Maximum Supportable Situation (MSS), Least Acceptable Solution (LAS), and Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA).
- b. Collect and analyze industry and competitor information.
- c. Make a list of the most critical arguments and understand the points of leverage.
- d. Plan the details of the negotiations and conduct internal trial runs, if required.

Important  Note:  An  individual  can  perform  multiple  roles  within  the  'Negotiations  Team'  (if required). The 'Negotiations Team' must consist of a minimum of two members.

## 3) Invite Suppliers and conduct negotiations

The  'Project  Owner'  invites  identified Suppliers for  negotiations  via  the  'Message  Board' functionality.  Post-negotiations,  if  an  agreement  is  reached  between  the Supplier and  the Procurement ,  the  'Project  Owner'  publishes  the  post  negotiation  Sourcing  Event  to  record updated Supplier responses.

In cases an agreement cannot be reached post-negotiations, the 'Project Owner' may take one of the following approaches:

- a. If  the  original  bids  are  acceptable,  the  'Project  Owner'  proceeds  to  the  'Approve Recommendation of Award' task considering the original bids.
- b. If the original bids are unacceptable, the 'Project Owner' cancels the Sourcing Event. The 'Project Owner' may modify the 'Sourcing Strategy' or just conduct another Sourcing Event, to obtain the desired results.

## 2.3.3.(VIII) Create and Execute Post-Negotiations Sourcing Event

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

To register post-negotiations Suppliers' responses in 'SAP Ariba', the 'Project Owner' creates and executes a post negotiation Sourcing Event (linked to the original SR).

The purpose of this process is to create a Sourcing Event (linked to the SR) to record post negotiations responses in 'SAP Ariba'.

<!-- image -->

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.3.22 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Create and Execute Post-Negotiations Sourcing Event

## 1) Create post negotiation Sourcing Event

The 'Project Owner' can create a post-negotiations Sourcing Event in following ways:

## a. Using additional Sourcing Event in the original 'Sourcing Project'

As recommended in Reverse Auction (eAuction), the 'Project Owner' may use the additional Sourcing  Event  within  the  'Full  Sourcing  Project'  to  obtain  negotiated  bids  from  the Suppliers.

## b. Post-negotiations Quick Project

The 'Project Owner' may create an additional 'Quick Sourcing Project' (linked to the original SR) for Suppliers to provide negotiated bids. This is done by creating another 'Subproject' from the 'Documents' tab of the associated 'Sourcing Request'.

Important Note: If another 'Quick Sourcing Project' is used to obtain negotiated bids, the original 'Sourcing Project' must be closed by changing the 'Project State' to 'Completed' in the 'Overview' tab.

## 2) Prepare, publish and execute the Sourcing Event

In  case,  an  additional  Souring  Event  within  the  original  'Full  Sourcing  Project'  is  used  for recording negotiated bids in 'SAP Ariba', the 'Project Owner' completes all activities specified in Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event for a 'Full Sourcing Project'.

In case an additional 'Quick Sourcing Project' is created to record post-negotiations bids in 'SAP Ariba', the 'Project Owner' completes all activities specified for 'Quick Sourcing Projects' in Create 'Sourcing Project' and Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event.

In either case, the 'Project Owner' may download the content of the original Sourcing Event and upload it in the new Sourcing Event. The Sourcing Event content can be modified in the new Sourcing Event, as required.

Important Note: The 'Project Owner' must invite all Suppliers that participated in the negotiations to provide negotiated responses in the post-negotiations Sourcing Event.

## 3) Verify Suppliers' responses

Detailed evaluations are not required for post-negotiations Sourcing Event. The 'Project Owner' reviews the updated bids to ensure that they are in line with negotiations conducted.

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.3.24 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Award and Event Close Out

## 1) Ensure all winning Suppliers are 'Qualified'

The  'Project  Owner'  ensures  that Suppliers considered  for  an  award  are  'Qualified'  in  the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS. The process to 'Qualify' a Supplier in  the Supplier Master Database is explained in the section 2.8.3.(IV) .

## Important Note: Disqualified Suppliers should not be considered for awards.

## 2) Prepare the 'Award Recommendation Report' and 'Award Scenarios'

The 'Project Owner' creates the following:

## a. 'Award Recommendation Report'

The 'Award Recommendation Report' summarizes the execution of 'Souring Project' and provides details of award.

In case that the negotiations were not conducted, the 'Project Owner' creates the 'Award Recommendation Report' after the Sourcing Event evaluation and attach it along with the 'Award Scenarios' for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA .

In case negotiations were conducted, the 'Project Owner' creates the 'Award Recommendation  Report'  post-negotiations  and  attaches  it  along  with  the  'Award Scenarios' for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA .

The 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' contains an 'Award Recommendation Report' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:

<!-- image -->

Table 2.3.12 'Award Recommendation Report' in 'SAP Ariba'

| Section Name                    | Description                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Executive Summary            | To provide an executive summary of the 'Award Recommendation Report' document.  |
| 2. Recommendation Summary       | To document details of bidder(s) recommended for award.                         |
| 3. Savings Summary              | To document the projected savings.                                              |
| 4. Sourcing Event Chronology    | To document the chronology for the 'Sourcing Project'.                          |
| 5. Evaluation Criteria          | To summarize the technical and commercial evaluation criteria.                  |
| 6. Technical Evaluation Summary | To compare and summarize the technical qualifications for shortlisted bidders.  |
| 7. Commercial Evaluation        | To summarize the overall cost comparison for shortlisted bidders.               |
| 8. Negotiation                  | To summarize the negotiation outcomes.                                          |
| 9. Contract Details             | To summarize the contract details including final delivery schedule &timetable. |

The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Award Recommendation Report' template provided in the 'Sourcing Project' or other approved template covering the required elements.

Important  Note:  In  case  of  'Quick  Sourcing  Project',  the  'Award  Recommendation  Report'  is provided in the 'Sourcing Library' from where it can be downloaded, completed, and attached with the 'Award Scenarios'.

## b. 'Award Scenarios'

Creating 'Award Scenarios' is the process to allocate the line items to winning Suppliers in 'SAP Ariba'. This allocation follows through to 'Contract Workspace' and to 'Procure to Order (P2O) module' (once enabled).

In case the 'Bid Console' functionality is used, the 'Project Owner' can define a criterion in 'Bid Console' to automatically allocate line items to the successful Suppliers . Alternatively, the  'Project  Owner'  may  allocate  line  items  manually.  A  line  item  may  be  split  among winning Suppliers if required. Please refer to section 10.22 of the Procurement Standards to understand how to resolve a tie among Suppliers .

Important Note: Approval of 'Awards Scenarios' is mandatory for 'Sourcing Project' completion in 'SAP Ariba'.

## 3) Obtain approvals for 'Award Scenario' and 'Award Recommendation Report'

The completed 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report' are approved by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . 'Approval' tasks are initiated in 'Sourcing Module' once all predecessor tasks are 'Completed'.

If 'Approvers' reject the 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report', they must provide  a  valid justification  to  the  'Project  Owner'.  The  'Project  Owner'  makes  the

<!-- image -->

recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report' for approval.

As soon as the 'Approvers' approve the 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report', the 'Sourcing Project' automatically closes for any further modifications.

## 4) Communicate award to winning Suppliers.

Once  the  'Award  Scenarios'  are  'Approved',  'SAP  Ariba'  can  automatically  send  a  systemgenerated email to  the  winning Suppliers, providing  them  with  the  details  of  the  line  items awarded to them. The 'Project Owner' needs to enable this automated email when creating the 'Award Scenarios'.

## 5) Accept/reject the award

The 'Project Owner' tracks the acceptance/rejection of the award by winning Suppliers . In case the winning Suppliers reject the award, the 'Project Owner' may take one of the following steps:

## a. Consider the next eligible Supplier for award

The 'Project Owner' can create another 'Quick Sourcing Project' (linked to the same SR) where the next eligible Supplier is invited to provide final bids. Please refer to section 2.3.3. (VIII)-(2.3.3.(VII)ii) for the details of the process.

## b. Modify 'Sourcing Strategy'

The 'Project Owner' cancels this Sourcing Event and modifies the 'Sourcing Strategy'. The Sourcing Events are created and executed following the newly approved 'Sourcing Strategy' to fulfil the requirements.

The selected way forward is endorsed by the Head of Procurement .

Important Note: If a 'Bid Bond Certificate' has been provisioned in the Sourcing Event, the "Project Owner" must inform the Finance to appropriate the Bid Bond for winning  Suppliers who have rejected  the  award.  The  'Project  Owner'  may  recommend adding  such  Suppliers  to  the list of blacklisted Suppliers in the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS.

Important  Note:  The  'Sourcing  Project'  must  be  closed  by  changing  the  'Project  State'  to 'Completed' in the 'Overview' tab, even if it is not awarded.

## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities

| Role          | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Owner | 1. Create/update and submit 'Award Recommendation Report' and 'Award Scenario'. 2. Communicate award to winning Suppliers and confirm acceptance/rejection. 3. If winning Suppliers reject the award, decide on the next course of action and coordinate with the Finance to appropriate the Bid Bond amount (if applicable). 4. If winning Suppliers reject the award, prepare and publish additional 'Quick Sourcing Project' within the same SR to obtain final bids from next eligible Suppliers . |

## 2.3.3.(X) Cancel Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

Cancellation  of  a  Sourcing  Event/'Sourcing  Project'/'Sourcing  Request'  implies  lost  time  and resources and should only be done as a last resort.

However,  in  certain  circumstances,  it  might  be  necessary  to  cancel  a  Sourcing  Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'. Such scenarios may include (but not limited to):

- 1) 'Sourcing Request' is no longer valid (requested goods/services/projects are not required anymore).
- 2) Suppliers shortlisted for the Sourcing Event did not respond to the event.
- 3) Suppliers responses to a Sourcing Event are invalid and cannot be evaluated.
- 4) No agreement reached post-negotiations, and original bids are not acceptable.

The purpose of this process is to cancel the Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' in 'SAP Ariba', as required and inform the participating Suppliers .

<!-- image -->

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.3.26 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Cancel Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'

## 1) Add 'Cancel Sourcing Event' task

The 'Cancel  Sourcing  Event'  is  not  a  default  task  within  the  'Sourcing  Project'.  In  case  the Sourcing Event needs to be cancelled, the 'Project Owner' adds the 'Cancel Sourcing Event" task via the 'Overview' tab.

## 2) Create and obtain approvals for 'Event Cancellation Request'

The 'Project Owner' creates an 'Event Cancellation Request' and submit it for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA .

The  'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Sourcing  Project'  contains  an  'Event  Cancellation  Request' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Event Cancellation Request' template provided in the 'Sourcing Project' or other approved template covering the required elements.

## 3) Cancel the Sourcing Event

In case the 'Event Cancellation Request' is approved , the 'Project Owner' cancels the respective Sourcing Event in 'SAP Ariba'. The 'Project Owner' can cancel the event by updating the event details and marking the event 'Cancelled'.

Important Note: In the case of 'Quick Sourcing Project', the 'Project Owner' executes the above process steps outside 'SAP Ariba'. The 'Approvers' for 'Event Cancellation Request' are same as the 'Approvers' for Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event process.

## 4) Send 'Event Cancellation Notice' to Suppliers

'Event Cancellation Notice' is the automated email sent to all participating Suppliers when the Sourcing Event gets cancelled.

## 5) Cancel 'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'

A  'Sourcing  Project'  should  only  be  cancelled  if  all  events  within  the  'Sourcing  Project'  are cancelled.  Similarly,  a  'Sourcing  Request'  should  be  cancelled  only  if  all  'Sourcing  Projects' associated with the 'Sourcing Request' are cancelled.

<!-- image -->

'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' can be cancelled by changing the respective status in the 'Overview' tab. The 'Project Owner' must obtain relevant approvals as per the PDoA before cancelling a 'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'. These approvals are managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities

## 2.4 Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)

## 2.4.1 Overview

The  Contract  Lifecycle  Management  (CLM)  process  group  consists  of  procedures  associated  with creation, management, and closure of contracts.

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the CLM processes.

<!-- image -->

Below is an illustration of the CLM level 3 processes:

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.4.1 CLM Procurement Processes (Level 3)

The CLM process group interacts with the Supplier Performance and Relationship Management (SPRM) process group (to evaluate supplier performance against the contract) and the Requisition to Pay (R2P) process group (to manage associated downstream activities). Details of these processes are provided in 2.5 and 2.6 , respectively.

<!-- image -->

Currently, Requisition to Pay (R2P) process group is managed in 'ORACLE ADERP'. Consequently, the procurement  practitioners  must  switch  between  'ORACLE  ADERP'  and  'SAP  Ariba',  as  illustrated below:

Figure 2.4.2 Procurement processes across 'ORACLE' and 'SAP Ariba.'

<!-- image -->

Below is an illustration  of the  process  once  the  Requisition  to Pay  (R2P)  process  group  is  enabled through 'SAP Ariba':

Figure 2.4.3 Procurement Processes - 'SAP Ariba'

<!-- image -->

## 2.4.2 'SAP Ariba Module' Overview

The  CLM  process  group  is  enabled  through  the  "SAP  Ariba  Contract  Lifecycle  Management  (CLM) module". Each contract associates to a 'Contract Workspace' (in the 'CLM module') which has predefined 'Tasks', 'Team Members', 'Documents', and approval chains configured to enable efficient creation and management of any contract.

The CLM processes are executed in the 'Contract Workspace,' as illustrated below:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.4.4 CLM processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages

The Publish  Contract enables the creation, review, approval, and publishing of the contract in the 'Contract  Workspace'.  The Manage Contract enables  the  management  of  contract  amendments, claims, penalties, and disputes that may arise during the lifecycle of the contract. The Close Contract enables the closure/termination of the 'Contract Workspace' and completion of associated tasks.

A Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned as the "Project Owner" of the 'Contract Workspace'. For a 'Contract Workspace' created against an Entity-Specific Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the Entity managing the category. For a 'Contract Workspace' created against a Common Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the GPO. The 'Contract Workspace' for call-off contract (executed pursuant to the Common Category) is created and managed by the Entity executing the same.

## Figure 2.4.5 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate and Review Contract

## 1) Create 'Contract Workspace'

A 'Contract Workspace' can be created in following ways:

## a. From 'Sourcing Project' (Post 'Awards Scenario' approval)

This is the preferred method for creating a 'Contract Workspace' that is linked to a 'Sourcing Project'. Once the 'Awards Scenario' is approved, the 'Project Owner' of the 'Sourcing Project'  creates  a  'Contract  Workspace',  completes  the  'Overview  Form'  to  create  the 'Contract Workspace'. In this case, the 'Project Owner' of the 'Sourcing Project' marks the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead as the 'Project Owner' of the 'Contract Workspace'.

Depending upon the number of winning Suppliers , multiple 'Contract Workspaces' may be created against a 'Sourcing Project'. In this case, each 'Contract Workspace' has the 'Main Contract Document' and 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)' specific to the Supplier . Below is an illustration of the same:

Figure 2.4.6: Link between 'Sourcing Module' and 'CLM module.'

<!-- image -->

Review 'Contract Folder' documents

<!-- image -->

## b. From 'Sourcing Project' (during the creation of the Sourcing Event itself)

This method of creating a 'Contract Workspace' is preferred when the 'Project Owner' (or associated 'Contract Manager') of the 'Sourcing Project' believes that the review of the 'Main Contract Document' requires significant time and can be done alongside the 'Sourcing Project' execution. Please refer to section 2.3.3.(IV)ii.2) for details.

## c. From the 'SAP Ariba Dashboard'

The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead creates a 'Contract Workspace' from 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' by selecting 'Contract Workspace (Procurement)' from 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' and completing the 'Overview Form'.

The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead provides UNSPSC Level 2 category is provided in the 'Commodity' field in the 'Overview Form'.

The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may link the 'Contract Workspace' to a previously executed 'Contract Workspace' or 'Sourcing Project' by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In case, the 'Contract Workspace' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Contract Workspace', the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project  Groups'  and  documents  from  the  previously  executed  project  into  the  current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Contract Workspace'.

The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead selects the 'Contract Domain', 'Hierarchical Type', and 'Term Type' while completing the 'Overview Form' as explained below.

Important Note: 'Contract Workspace' cannot be created against Suppliers with 'Disqualified' status in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the DGS.

## 2) Select the 'Contract Domain'

The contract can be a Goods contract, Services contract, or a Capital Projects contract.

## 3) Select the 'Hierarchical Type'

Contract hierarchies are used to organize and view related contracts, to combine pricing terms across selected contracts, and to roll up accumulated spend amounts throughout the hierarchy.

The 'CLM module' enables the 'Project Owner' to organize contracts into hierarchies where a master agreement (also known as framework agreement) is the parent to one or more subagreements (also known as call-off contract). The stand-alone agreement is a contract that is not part a contract hierarchy and is executed by the Entity for its own requirements. Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy:

## 'FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT'

## MANAGEMENT PLAN

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Contains elements common to multiple Entities e.g., pricing (3AED per apple), guarantees, overall terms and conditions

Contains elements specific to each Entity e.g., delivery locations (Corniche 1), authorized requesters, SLAs

Contains delivery request(s) issues by each Entity defining date(s), quantity etc. in line with the provisions on FA and call off  contract.

e.g., PO for entity 1 for 3 apples at 3AED each to be delivered at Corniche

Figure 2.4.7: Master Agreement - Sub-agreement Hierarchy type

As  illustrated  above,  multiple  sub  agreements  may  roll  up  to  a  master  agreement.  The Entity/department executing the sub-agreement raises the Purchase Orders (PO) against the same.

Important Note: The Entity/department executing the sub-agreement owns the management of the  sub-agreement.  The  Entity/department  can  make  necessary  amendments  or  manage  any Claim/Penalty/Dispute for the sub-agreement.

Depending upon the type of agreement, suitable 'Hierarchical Type' is selected in the 'Overview Form'. If the sub-agreement is selected as the 'Hierarchical Type', the 'Project Owner' must provide a master agreement reference in the 'Overview Form'.

Important  Note:  Master  agreement  and  sub-agreements  are  managed  via  different  'Contract Workspaces' in 'SAP Ariba'.

## 4) Select the 'Term Type'

The following are 'Term Type' available in a 'Contract Workspace':

- a. Fixed -  A fixed-term  contract is  a  contractual  relationship  between  a Supplier and  an Entity/GPO that lasts for a specified period.
- b. Auto-Renew - Auto-Renew contracts may automatically extend past the expiration date. When using Auto-Renew, the 'Project Owner' specifies renewal interval and the maximum number of renewals.

<!-- image -->

The  'Contract  Workspace'  gets  activated  when  the  'Overview  form'  is  completed  and submitted  by  the  assigned Contracting  Specialist/Lead .  This Contracting  Specialist/Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project.

## 5) Assign 'Team Members'

The 'Team Members' are grouped into:

## a. 'Project Groups'

The 'Project Groups' enabled within the 'CLM module' are:

## a1. Project Owner

The 'Project Owner' is responsible for execution of 'Contract Workspace' tasks.

## a2. Procurement Manager

Procurement Manager is responsible for providing oversight of the CLM processes and ensuring  execution  is  compliant  with  the  Procurement  Standards  and  other  relevant regulations.

## a3. Contract Administrator

The  Contract  Administrator is  responsible  for  the  execution  of  the  contract.  The Contract Administrator reviews the 'Contract Folder', contract claim/penalty/dispute, and initiates contract amendments.

## a4. Supplier

A Supplier is an individual or an organization that provides required goods/services/projects. In the 'Contract Workspace', the Supplier is  responsible  for reviewing the 'Contract Folder', executing the contract, and acknowledging termination notice and claim/penalty/dispute.

## a5. Budget Owner

The Budget Owner is  accountable  for  spending  decisions  of  the  section/department managing the contract . In the 'Contract Workspace', the Budget Owner is one of the approvers for the documents provided in the 'Contract Folder' before their execution.

## a6. Legal

The assigned member from the Legal is added to the 'Contract Workspace' to review the contract, contract amendments, and contract claim/penalty/dispute.

## a7. Finance

The assigned member from the Finance is added to the 'Contract Workspace' to review the contract, contract amendments, and contract claim/penalty/dispute.

## a8. Master Data Management

<!-- image -->

The assigned member from the Master Data Management is  added to the 'Contract Workspace' to review the contract, contract amendments, and contract claim/penalty/dispute.

## a9. 'Project Observers'

'Project Observers' are responsible for only observing the progress of the 'Sourcing Project'. Participants of this group are pre-determined. The 'Project Owner' can add members to this group but cannot modify the existing members.

## b. 'System Groups'

'System Groups' are  groups of participants  pre-determined  for  a  'Contract  Workspace' (e.g., 'Approvers' and 'Reviewers'). The 'Project Owner' can add members to the 'System Groups' but cannot modify the existing members.

## 6) Add/update 'Contract Folder' documents

The 'Documents' tab of the 'Contract Workspace' contains a 'Contract Folder'. The 'Contract Folder' is the key document folder that is shared with the 'Reviewers' and 'Approvers' at every stage. It may contain the following documents, depending upon the nature of the contract:

## a. 'Main Contract Document'

The 'Main Contract Document' is the legal document that defines the basis of the contract, including both parties' roles, responsibilities, and  a detailed description of the work. The 'Main Contract Document' could be the master agreement, sub-agreement or stand-alone agreement. The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Main Contract Document' templates provided in  'SAP  Ariba  Contracting  Library'  or  other  approved  template  covering  the  required elements.

Important Note: The 'Main Contract Document' may include the provision for a Performance Bond for the Supplier. Please refer to section 1.5 to review the exceptions to the Performance Bond.

## b. 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)'

The  line  items  associated  with  the  contract  are  created  and  managed  in  the  'Contract Workspace' as 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)'. These may include information regarding (but not limited to) specifications, unit of measure (UOM) and prices.

In  case  the  'Contract  Workspace'  is  linked to  a  'Sourcing  Project',  the  'Project  Owner' imports the 'CLID' from the 'Sourcing Project' directly. In case the 'Contract Workspace' is not linked to a 'Sourcing Project', the 'Project Owner' creates 'CLID' within the 'Contract Workspace' in the following ways:

- b1. Create 'CLID' directly in 'SAP Ariba'.
- b2. Download, complete, and upload the 'CLID' excel template.

<!-- image -->

## c. 'Termination Notice'

The 'Termination Notice' is a legal notice to the Supplier confirming the termination of a contract.  The  'Termination  Notice'  should  always  be  prepared  in  collaboration  with  the Legal .  This  document  is  available  in  'Contract  Folder'  tab  once  the  'Termination' amendment is triggered.

## d. 'Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form'

The 'Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form' provides details of the raised claim/penalty/dispute. This document is available in 'Contract Folder' tab once the contract claim/penalty/dispute tasks are triggered.

Important Note: To publish a contract in the 'Contract Workspace', the 'Project Owner' must upload the 'Main Contract Document' and 'CLID', for review and approval. The 'Project Owner' may upload additional reference documents in the 'Contract Folder', if required.

## 7) Review 'Contract Folder' documents

All 'Review' tasks are performed uniformly across the 'Contract Workspace'. Below are the key activities for any 'Review' task:

- a. Step  1 -  The  'Project  Owner'  initiates  a  'Review'  task  by  providing  a  'Due  Date'  to  the 'Reviewer'.
- b. Step  2 -  The  'Reviewer'  opens  the  'Contract  Folder',  and  downloads  and  reviews  all required documents.
- c. Step 3 - The 'Reviewer' uploads the modified 'Contract Folder' documents (only in case of modifications) and clicks on 'Complete Review' with additional comments/attachments if required.
- d. Step 4 - The 'Project Owner' reviews the updated documents in the 'Contract Folder'. In case of modifications, the 'Project  Owner' may 'Accept All changes' or initiate another round of review. The latest version of the documents gets saved in the 'Contract Folder' (automatically) when the 'Project Owner' clicks on 'Accept All changes'.
- e. Step 5 - The 'Project Owner' marks the specific 'Review' task 'Complete' and initiates the next task.

In the 'CLM module', review by the Contract Administrator , the 'Supervisor' ( Contracting Lead or Procurement Manager) , and the Supplier are mandatory. The review with the Supplier is managed through a 'Negotiation' task, where the Supplier can either 'Accept Proposal' or 'Propose Counter Proposal' and attach modified documents.

<!-- image -->

Obtain approvals for 'Contract Folder' documents

Obtain contract signatures

Create 'Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Project'

Publish Contract

## Figure 2.4.9 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Approve and Publish Contract

## 1) Obtain approvals for 'Contract Folder' documents

All 'Approval' tasks are performed uniformly across the 'Contract Workspace'. Below are the key activities for any 'Approval' task:

- a. Step 1 - The 'Project Owner' initiates an approval by providing a 'Due Date'.
- b. Step  2 -  The  'Approver'  opens  the  'Contract  Folder',  and  downloads  and  reviews  all required documents.
- c. Step 3 - The 'Approver' approves/denies the documents and provides comments/ attaches modified documents within the 'Approval' task.
- d. Step  4 -  In  case  the  'Approver'  has  denied  the  documents  (with  recommended changes/justification), the 'Project Owner' makes necessary changes and saves an updated version of documents in the 'Contract Folder'.
- e. Step 5 - If  the 'Project Owner' believes that the modified documents require review by 'Reviewers', the 'Project Owner' re-triggers specific 'Review' tasks.
- f. Step 6 -  In  case  the  review  by  the  'Reviewers'  is  not  required, the  'Project Owner' retriggers the 'Approval' task.
- g. Step 7 - If the 'Approver' approves the documents, the 'Contract Folder' moves to the next 'Approver' in the chain automatically, and Step 2 - Step 6 are repeated.
- h. Step 8 -  Once all  approvals are completed, the status of the 'Approval' task changes to 'Completed', automatically.

Important Note: Each 'Review' tasks is specific to a 'Reviewer', whereas an 'Approval' task is a single task with a chain of 'Approver'' designated as per the PDoA.

## 2) Obtain contract signatures

The 'Project Owner' obtains signatures on two hard copies of the 'Main Contract Document' from authorized signatories, starting with the Supplier . Obtaining signatures is an offline process. The 'Project Owner' uploads a scanned copy of the signed 'Main Contract Document' in the 'Contract Folder' and marks the task 'Complete'.

One  hard  copy  is  shared  with  the Supplier while  the  other  hard  copy  is  retained  by  the Procurement after the contract is 'Published' in 'SAP Ariba'.

<!-- image -->

## 3) Create 'Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Project' (optional task)

As  illustrated  in Figure 2.4.1,  the  'CLM  module'  interacts  with  the  'Supplier  Performance Management module' to monitor supplier performance against the respective contract. The 'Project  Owner'  creates  a  'Supplier  Performance  Management  (SPM)  Project'  against  the 'Contract Workspace,' as explained in section 2.5.3.(III)ii.1).

## 4) Publish contract

The  'Project  Owner'  can  publish  a  contract  through  the  'Overview'  tab  of  the  'Contract Workspace'. Upon completing this activity, the 'Project Owner' confirms that the status of the contract is 'Published'. Only a 'Published' contract can be used for the Requisition to Pay (R2P) processes.

## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities

## 2.4.3.(III) Initiate Contract Amendment

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The contract amendment allows to make modifications to the existing contract, which have been approved  and  agreed  with  the Supplier .  An  amendment  may  be  an  addition,  deletion,  or modification to the existing contract. The original contract remains in place,  along with changes made via the amendment.

In the 'Contract Workspace', the following types of contract amendments are feasible:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 'Administrative'

- Changes that do not affect or alter the rights of the Entity /

## Supplier

- No financial / material impact
- Include (not limited to):
-  Change in 'Team Members'
-  Changes in billing instruction or address
-  Correction of typographical errors
-  Other changes permitted by the contract clause

No amendment tasks

'Termination'

## For convenience

- To protect the Entity's interest
- Notify Supplier of extent, reason, effective date

## For default

- Continuous unsatisfactory performance; failure of Suppliers to mobilize within timeframe; breach of the provisions of the contract

## 'Renewal / Extension'

- Requested by End-Users or initiated by the Procurement on behalf of the End-User
- Renewals permitted only if relevant provision allowing for renewal exists in the contract
- Procurement to verify that sufficient approved budget is available for 'Renewal/ Extension'

## 'Amendment'

- Changes into the   contract by adding, removing, or changing the obligations or benefits
- May include Change Orders, Change Requests, scope modification etc.
- Claims / Penalties / Disputes are considered as a type of an 'Amendment' in 'SAP Ariba'
- Price update is also done through 'Amendment'
- Give Supplier a grace period to rectify performance

Respective amendment tasks in SAP Ariba

## Figure 2.4.11 Contract amendments in 'Contract Workspace.'

The  'Administrative'  amendments  do  not  have  associated  'Review'  and  'Approval'  tasks.  The 'Project Owner' can directly make 'Administrative' amendments and publish without any review or approvals. On the other hand, selecting 'Amendment', 'Renewal/Extension', or 'Termination' type of amendments  creates  pre-defined  'To  Do',  'Review',  and  'Approval'  tasks  in  the  'Contract Workspace', which are referred to as amendment tasks.

Important Note: The 'Project Owner' executes modification to the unit price, UOM, or the quantity of the 'CLID' through 'Amendment' type of amendment in 'SAP Ariba'.

The purpose of this process is to initiate various types of amendment to the contract, as required.

Initiate contract amendment

Edit information and complete amendment

Review 'Termination Checklist'

Add/update documents in the 'Contract Folder'

## Figure 2.4.12 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate Contract Amendment

## 1) Receive and validate amendment (offline process)

An amendment request is raised either by the Supplier or the Contract Administrator . In either case, the Contract Administrator confirms the validity of the amendment before the 'Project Owner' initiates respective tasks in 'Contract Workspace'. The Contract Administrator reviews the  amendment with the Budget Owner to  ensure  the  necessary  budget  is  available  for  the proposed amendment. This validation of the amendment is managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.

If  the amendment is invalid, it is communicated to respective stakeholders, and any relevant query is resolved. In case the amendment is valid, and the budget availability is confirmed, the Contract  Administrator communicates  the  details  of  the  amendment  and  asks  the  'Project Owner' to initiate the amendment tasks.

## 2) Initiate contract amendment

The  'Project  Owner'  initiates  an  amendment  through  the  'Overview'  tab  and  selects  the suitable amendment type. Following are the types of the contract amendments enabled in 'SAP Ariba':

- a. 'Administrative' amendment
- b. 'Amendment' amendment
- c. 'Renewal/Extension' amendment
- d. 'Termination' amendment

## 3) Edit information and complete amendment

In  case  of  'Administrative'  amendment,  the  'Project  Owner'  can  modify  the  'Overview' information and the 'Team Member' and publish the contract directly through the 'Overview' tab, without any reviews or approvals.

## 4) Review 'Termination Checklist'

In  case  of  'Termination'  amendment,  the  'Project  Owner'  reviews  and  completes  the 'Termination Checklist' first. The 'Project Owner' may use the checklist provided in 'Contract Workspace' or other approved template covering the required elements.

## 2.4.3.(V) Initiate Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

In the 'Contract Workspace', contract claim/penalty/dispute is initiated through 'Amendment' type of amendment and managed through pre-defined claim/penalty/dispute tasks.

Important Note: Only one set of claim/penalty/dispute tasks is available for claim/penalty/dispute in a 'Contract Workspace'. In case multiple claims/penalties/disputes arise during the contract lifecycle, they are managed by re-initiating the already completed 'Claim/Penalty/Dispute tasks'.

The purpose of this process is to initiate a claim/penalty/dispute against the contract.

Raise/validate contract claim/penalty/dispute (Contract Administrator)

Initiate contract claim/penalty/ dispute tasks

Fill and submit 'Claim/Penalty/ Dispute Logging Form'

## Figure 2.4.16 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute

## 1) Raise/validate contract claim/penalty/dispute

A contract claim/penalty/dispute is raised by either the Supplier or the Contract Administrator . In either case, the Contract Administrator confirms the validity of the claim/penalty/dispute. The Contract Administrator reviews the claim/penalty/dispute along with the Budget Owner of the  contract  to  ensure  necessary  budget  availability  (in  case  the  claim/penalty/dispute  is proposed by the Supplier ).

If the claim/penalty/dispute is invalid, it is communicated to the respective stakeholders, and any  relevant  query  is  resolved.  In  case  the  claim/penalty/dispute  is  valid,  the Contract Administrator communicates  the  details  of  the  claim/penalty/dispute  and  asks  the  'Project Owner' to initiate the claim/penalty/dispute tasks. This validation of the claim/penalty/dispute is managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## 2) Initiate contract claim/penalty/dispute tasks

To initiate the claim/penalty/dispute tasks, the 'Project Owner' selects the 'Amendment' type of amendment, responds 'Yes' to the claim/penalty/dispute template question.

## 3) Fill and submit 'Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form'

The 'Project Owner' downloads the 'Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form' document from  the  'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Contract  Workspace'  and  sends  it  to  the Contract Administrator .

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The Contract  Administrator completes  the  'Contract  Claim/Penalty/Dispute  Logging  Form' document with relevant details and sends it back to the 'Project Owner' to be uploaded in the 'Contract  Folder'.  The  'Project  Owner'  may  upload  additional  documents  in  the  'Contract Folder' in support of the claim/penalty/dispute, if required.

## 2.4.3.(VIII) Close Contract

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The  purpose  of  this  process  is  to  close  or  terminate  the  contract,  as  required.  A  'Contract Workspace' may be closed in the following scenarios:

- 1) All contractual obligations are met.
- 2) The 'Expiration Date' has passed, and the contract is 'Expired'.
- 3) The contract is being 'Terminated' (either for convenience or for default).

This process covers all three scenarios and associated activities.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Monitor 'Contract Workspace' for closure/expiry

Edit 'Expiration Date', if required

Communicate contract closure to stakeholders

Complete 'Contract Closure Checklist'

Figure 2.4.22 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Close Contract

<!-- image -->

## 1) Monitor 'Contract Workspace' for closure/expiry

The 'Project Owner' in collaboration with Contract Administrator monitors the following for an open contract:

- a. Supplier performance against the contract through 'SPM Project'
- b. Status of contractual obligations to estimate the contract closure
- c. Upcoming contract expiry

In case the 'Expiration Date' of the contract approaches (before all contractual obligations are met), the 'Project Owner' may extend the 'Expiration Date' to allow the Supplier to meet all contractual obligations, provided such an extension is requested by Contract Administrator and has been duly approved. If relevant provisions exist in the contract, the 'Project Owner' may renew the contract after obtaining required approvals.

The process for 'Extension/Renewal' amendment is explained in section 2.4.3.(IV).

In case the contract is not to be renewed or extended, either the 'Project Owner' closes the 'Contract Workspace', or the 'Contract Workspace' automatically expires as per the initially set 'Expiration Date' (irrespective of the incomplete contractual obligations).

## 2) Complete 'Contract Closure Checklist'

The  'Contract  Closure  Checklist'  contains  a  comprehensive  list  of  activities  to  be  completed before  the  contract  is  expired  or  closed.  The  'Project  Owner'  can  download  the  'Contract Closure  Checklist'  document  from  the  'Documents'  tab  of  the  'Contract  Workspace'.  The 'Project Owner' completes and uploads the 'Contract Closure Checklist' in the 'Contract Folder' along with any relevant documents.

## 3) Edit 'Expiration Date', if required

In case of 'Termination' amendment or contract early closure, the 'Project Owner' proceeds to modify the contract 'Expiration Date' and close the 'Contract Workspace' as required.

Important Note: There are no 'Reviews' and 'Approval' tasks for contract closure and expiry. The 'Reviews'  and  'Approval'  tasks  for  'Termination'  amendment  are  already  covered  in  Section 2.4.3.(IV).

## 4) Communicate contract closure to stakeholders (offline process)

The  'Project  Owner'  completes  the  following  activities  post-closure  or  'Termination'  of  the 'Contract Workspace', outside 'SAP Ariba':

## 2.5 Supplier Performance and Relationship Management (SPRM)

## 2.5.1 Overview

Supplier Performance and Relationship Management (SPRM) process group consists of procedures to segment, manage relationships and performance of Suppliers .

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the SPRM processes.

Below is an illustration of SPRM Level 3 processes:

Figure 2.5.1 SPRM Procurement Processes (Level 3)

<!-- image -->

## 2.5.2 'SAP Ariba Modules' Overview

The SPRM processes are grouped into three distinct stages, enabled either through an 'SAP Ariba module'  or  managed  offline.  Below  is  an  illustration  of  these  stages  and  respective  'SAP  Ariba modules' enabling them:

<!-- image -->

| SPRM Stages        | Segment Suppliers                                     | Manage Supplier Relationship                 | Manage Supplier Performance                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enabled by         | 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' | (Offline Process)                            | 'SAP Ariba Supplier Performance Mgmt. (SPM) Module'              |
| Business Processes | 1. Segment Suppliers                                  | 2. Set Relationships with Selected Suppliers | 3. Evaluate Supplier Performance 4. Monitor Supplier Performance |

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.5.2 SPRM processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages

Segment Suppliers is  enabled through 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'. A 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)' is created at the GPO level to categorize all Suppliers catering to Common Categories and at each Entity level to categorize all Suppliers catering to EntitySpecific Categories. An SRM Specialist is  assigned as  the  "Project  Owner" for 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'.

Manage  Supplier  Relationships enables  development  of  collaborative  relationships  with  selected Suppliers .  It  is  executed at the GPO level for Suppliers catering to Common Categories and at each Entity level for Suppliers catering to Entity-Specific Categories. This stage is executed entirely outside 'SAP Ariba'. An SRM Specialist may be assigned as the single point of contact (SPOC) to execute and manage process for shortlisted Suppliers .

The Manage Supplier Performance enables evaluation, monitoring, and management of the Supplier performance against  open  contracts.  It  is  enabled  through  the  'SAP  Ariba  Supplier  Performance Management (SPM) Module'. For a Common Category contract, the 'SPM project' is created and managed by the GPO, and for an Entity-Specific Category contract, the 'SPM project' is created and managed by the respective Entity. The Contracting Specialist/Lead assigned as the 'Project Owner' of the original 'Contract Workspace' should be assigned the 'Project Owner' of the associated 'SPM project'.

## 2.5.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

## 2.5.3.(I) Segment Suppliers

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

Segment  Suppliers  process  is  executed  periodically,  preferably  once  a  year.  The  process  of segmenting Suppliers into  pre-defined  groups  (Strategic,  Critical,  Transactional,  and  Operational) enables the procurement to optimize and prioritize its efforts and focus on developing long-term relationships with the right Suppliers.

Important Note: While segmenting Suppliers, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each  Supplier  for  the  same  period  to  maintain  a  fair  comparison.  Suppliers  that  do  not  have contracted spend for the period of review may not be considered for Segment Suppliers process.

The purpose of this process is to conduct the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' and prepare the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in the 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'.

## Figure 2.5.3 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Segment Suppliers

## 1) Create the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)'

The  assigned SRM  Specialist creates  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Supplier  Segmentation)'  by selecting  the  "Knowledge  Projects'  from  'SAP  Ariba  Dashboard',  completing  the  'Overview Form', and selecting the 'Supplier Segmentation Template'.

The assigned SRM Specialist may  link  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Supplier  Segmentation)'  to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In case, the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)', the assigned SRM Specialist may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project

into  the  current  project.  This  imported  information  is  modifiable  in  the  current  'Contract Workspace'

The 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' gets activated when the 'Overview Form' is completed and submitted by the assigned SRM Specialist .  This SRM Specialist becomes  the 'Project Owner' of the project.

## 2) Assign Procurement Manager

The 'Project Owner' assigns the Procurement Manager in the 'Teams' tab. The Procurement Manager is  responsible  for  providing  oversight  of  the  Supplier  Segmentation  process  and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

## 3) Prepare and publish 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey'

The 'Project Owner' creates the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' by completing the following components:

## a. Survey Rules

These rules define execution of the survey, such as:

- a1. Timing Rules - define time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

## b. Survey Participants

Category Managers of the Entity-Specific Categories or Common Categories participate in the respective 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey'.

For the categories, where the Category Managers are not assigned, Contract Administrators or End-Users involved in the category procurement participate in the survey.

## c. Survey Content

The 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' content includes a 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document, which needs to be filled by survey participants. Following is the structure of the document:

Table 2.5.1 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document structure

| Tab Name                        | Description                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Data Inputs                  | To provide scores for 'Business Impact and 'Supplier Risk/Complexity'                                     |
| 2. Supplier Segmentation Output | To segment the 'Category - Supplier' combination; (automated tab)                                         |
| 3. Final Supplier Segment       | To provide overall segmentation of the Supplier.                                                          |
| 4. Scoring Guidelines           | Reference tab; to provide 'Business Impact and 'Supplier Risk/Complexity' scores in the 'Data Inputs' tab |
| 5. Category Taxonomy            | Reference tab; to fill level 2 category in the 'Data Inputs' tab                                          |

## 4) Respond to the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey'

The Supplier Segmentation depends on two parameters:

<!-- image -->

- a. Business Impact of the Supplier implies how vital the Supplier is to business operations and future initiatives.
- b. Supplier Risk /Complexity implies the dependence on the Supplier and ease of switching the Supplier , if required.

The detailed criteria to score a Supplier on these parameters are provided in the 'Scoring Guidelines' tab of the 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document. A higher score implies higher business impact/complexity of the Supplier being evaluated. Scores on these two parameters serve as the criteria for segmenting the Supplier into one of the following segments:

- b1. Strategic  Supplier  Strategic  Suppliers  are  the Suppliers that  show  potential  of innovation and collaboration. These Suppliers usually have a proven track record and are some of the highest spend Suppliers .  An SRM Specialist is  assigned to each Strategic Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

b2.

b3. Figure 2.5.5.

Important Note: The Suppliers of Common Categories are considered as Strategic Suppliers by default, and GPO ensures execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements for these Suppliers.

- b4. Critical Supplier Critical Suppliers are critical to everyday operations, and any failure by such a Supplier usually has a significant impact. An SRM Specialist is assigned to each Critical  Supplier  to  monitor  and  ensure  execution  of  the  Supplier  Segment  Strategy elements specified in

b5.

- b6. Figure 2.5.5.
- b7. Operational  Supplier  Operational  Suppliers  have  contracted  commitments  that require operational tracking and delivery monitoring . Usually, s uch Suppliers are  not considered  for  development  and  collaboration  initiatives  or  Supplier  Risk  Profiling process.

In case an Operational Supplier is in top 80% of the Entity spend, an SRM Specialist is assigned to such a Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

Figure 2.5.5 .

<!-- image -->

Only in such a case, the Operational Supplier may be considered for development and collaboration initiatives or Supplier Risk Profiling process.

b8. Transactional  Supplier  Transactional  Suppliers  are  the Suppliers with  minimal contracted spend and least impact.

In case a Transactional Supplier is in top 80% of the Entity spend, an SRM Specialist is assigned to such a Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

Figure  2.5.5.  Only  in  such  a  case,  the  Transactional  Supplier  may  be  considered  for development and collaboration initiatives.

Suppliers are  segmented  at  the  category  level  as  well  as  overall  Entity/GPO  level.  The following is an illustration of a Supplier Segmentation Matrix:

Figure 2.5.4 Supplier Segmentation Matrix

<!-- image -->

The 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' is completed as follows:

## a. For categories with Category Managers

The 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document is filled for each category by the respective Category Manager. The Category Manager identifies and scores each Supplier, on the  above-explained  parameters,  within  the  category  in  the  'Data  Input'  tab  of  the document.

The Category Manager may share this document with the relevant Contract Administrators/End-Users to  collate  required  inputs.  The  collation  of  these  inputs  is

<!-- image -->

managed entirely outside 'SAP Ariba'. The Category Manager collates the inputs into one 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document, with information on all Suppliers for the respective category.

## b. For categories without Category Managers

The 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document is filled by the relevant Contract Administrators/End-Users.

The  survey  participants  upload  the  completed  'Supplier  Segmentation  -  Category  Specific' document in the 'SPM Project' as the survey response.

Important  Note:  While  collating  data  for  their  category,  the  Category  Manager  /  Contract Administrator / End-User are advised to ensure that the entire contracted spend is accounted for in the 'Data Inputs' tab.

## 5) Prepare 'Supplier Segmentation Report'

The 'Project  Owner'  downloads  and  collates  the  received  survey  responses  in  the  'Supplier Segmentation - Consolidated' document and modifies the 'Final Supplier Segment' tab. The 'Project  Owner'  can  download  the  'Supplier  Segmentation  Consolidated'  document  from 'Documents' tab.

Important Note: The 'Project Owner' is encouraged to validate the spend figures of the Suppliers during collation of survey responses and adjust them if required.

This  'Supplier  Segmentation  -  Consolidated'  document  when  completed  forms  the  'Supplier Segmentation Report'. Only one 'Supplier Segmentation Report' and should include all Suppliers .

The key outcome of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' is the Supplier Segmentation Matrix (illustrated in Figure 2.5.4) which provides a relative position of a Supplier .

## Important Note: All Common Category Suppliers are considered as Strategic Suppliers.

## 6) Obtain approval of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report'

'Project Owner' uploads the completed 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in 'Documents' tab for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA .

If 'Approvers' reject the 'Supplier Segmentation Report', they must provide a valid justification to  the  'Project  Owner'.  If  'Approvers'  recommend  changes  to  the  'Supplier  Segmentation Report', the 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and uploads the updated version of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' for approval.

If  the  'Approvers'  approve  the  'Supplier  Segmentation  Report',  the  respective  segment strategies are executed across Suppliers .

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The  approved  'Supplier  Segmentation  Report'  is  made  available  to  the Sourcing  Specialists/ Leads, Contracting Specialists/Leads , and SRM Specialists outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## 7) Implement the Supplier Segment Strategy

Following is a summary of the key aspects of the Supplier Segment Strategy for various Supplier segments:

## 2.5.3.(III) Evaluate Supplier Performance

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

Supplier performance is evaluated and monitored regularly against all open contracts. Below is an illustration of how the 'SPM Project' is linked to the 'Contract Workspace' and how a 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' can be created in the 'SPM module'

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.5.9 Example - Supplier Performance Creation

As  illustrated  above,  in  the  'SAP  Ariba  Sourcing  module',  two  'Sourcing  Projects'  are  executed where Supplier A wins selected line items. In the 'SAP Ariba CLM module', a 'Contract Workspace' is created against each 'Sourcing Project' with the 'Main Contract Document' and 'CLID' specific to Supplier A.

An  'SPM  Project'  is  created  against  a  'Contract  Workspace',  enabling  the  evaluation  and management of Supplier performance against the associated contract. (e.g., in above illustration an 'SPM Project' is created against each 'Contract Workspaces').

A key outcome of the 'SPM Project' is a 'Supplier Performance Scorecard', which summarizes how the Supplier is  performing  against  the  KPIs  and  goals  established  in  the  contract.  (e.g.,  in  above illustration, a 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' is created against each 'SPM Project')

'Supplier  Performance  Scorecards'  from  all  associated  'SPM  Projects'  for  the Supplier are consolidated, by 'SAP Ariba', to provide an overall 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'. (e.g., in above illustration, 'Supplier Performance Scorecards' against the two 'SPM Projects' merge into an overall 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' for Supplier A )

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The Contracting  Specialist/Lead assigned  as  the  'Project  Owner'  of  the  'Contract  Workspace' should be assigned the 'Project Owner' of the associated 'SPM Project'.

The purpose of this process is to conduct 'Supplier Performance Survey' and create the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan', if required, in the 'SPM Project'.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Set up 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' and 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'

Communicate performance goals to the Supplier

Review and publish 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'

Execute 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey'

Develop 'Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Plan'

## Figure 2.5.10 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Evaluate Supplier Performance

## 1) Create 'SPM Project'

The  assigned Contracting  Specialist/Lead creates  an  'SPM  Project'  either  from  within  a 'Contract Workspace' or by selecting the 'Supplier Performance Management Project' from 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' and completing the 'Overview Form'.

The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may link the 'SPM Project' to a previously executed 'SPM  Project'  or  'Contract  Workspace'  by  selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  field  in  the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In case, the 'SPM Project' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Contract Workspace', the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'SPM Project'.

The 'SPM Project' gets activated when the 'Overview Form' is completed and submitted by the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead .  This Contracting Specialist/Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project.

## 2) Assign 'Team Members'

The 'Team Members' are grouped into:

## a. 'Project Groups'

The 'Project Groups' enabled within 'SPM Project' are:

Obtain approvals for the 'SPM Plan'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## a1. Project Owner

The 'Project Owner' is responsible for execution of 'SPM Project' tasks.

## a2. SRM Specialist

SRM  Specialist is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving/denying  the  'Supplier Performance Management Plan'.

## a3. Contract Administrator

The assigned Contract Administrator in  the  original  'Contract  Workspace'  should be assigned as the Contract Administrator for the associated 'SPM Project' . The Contract Administrator is  one  of  the  'Supplier  Performance  Survey'  participants  and  an 'Approver' of the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan'.

## b. 'System Groups'

'System  Groups'  are  groups  of  participants  pre-determined  for  an  'SPM  Project'  (e.g., 'Approvers'  and  'Reviewers').  The  'Project  Owner'  can  add  members  to  the  'System Groups' but cannot modify the existing members.

## 3) Set up 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' and 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'

The 'Project Owner' sets up the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' by assigning weightage/target grade to each KPI.

The 'Project Owner' sets up the 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' by completing the following segments:

## a. Survey Rules

This segment specifies the rules for the execution of the survey, such as:

- a1. Timing Rules - defines time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

## b. Survey Participants

Contract  Administrator for  the  original  'Contract  Workspace'  and  other  identified EndUsers participate in the survey.

## c. Survey Content

The 'Supplier Performance Survey' focusses on assessing the Supplier performance against standard KPIs set up in an 'SPM Project'. These KPIs are:

<!-- image -->

## ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

- Does the Supplier act as a Strategic Partner?
- Does the Supplier show accountability?
- Does the Supplier proactively communicate deviations / challenges?
- Does the Supplier participate in new Business Opportunities?
- How fast does the Supplier respond to escalations?

<!-- image -->

DELIVERY

- Does the supplier deliver as per agreed schedule and quantities?
- Was there a 'Out of Stock' situation due to the Supplier?
- Does the Supplier offer flexibility in supply for any change in the demand?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

COST

QUALITY

<!-- image -->

- How competitive is the Supplier Pricing?
- Does the Supplier suggest cost saving initiatives?
- How transparent is the Supplier in terms of cost?
- Does the Supplier adhere to agreed rates for the term of the contract?

<!-- image -->

## INNOVATION

- Does the Supplier provide continuous improvement and innovation ideas?
- Does the Supplier implement leading practices in their operations?
- Has the supplier met SLAs of the contract?
- Complaints recorder in past quarter for the Supplier ?
- # of audit non-conformances in past quarter?
- Has the supplier closed all corrective points?
- Has the supplier maintained the quality certifications ?

<!-- image -->

RISK AND COMPLIANCE

- Does the Supplier comply with laws and regulatory requirements, manuals, company policies and procedures?
- Are the Supplier's risk mitigation activities satisfactory?
- Does the Supplier provide all delivery reports?
- Does the  Supplier comply with health, safety, and environment guidelines?

## Figure 2.5.11 Supplier Performance KPIs and default survey questions

These six KPIs are fixed for all 'SPM Projects' and should not be deleted from any survey. The 'Project Owner' may change the weightage of any KPI to '0' if the KPI is not applicable, but the KPI should not be removed from the survey and the scorecard. Similarly, no new KPI should be added to the survey and scorecard.

Based on the contract, against which the Supplier performance is being assessed, the 'Project Owner' may change:

- a. Weightage/target grade of KPIs
- b. Questions within each KPI

## 4) Communicate performance goals to the Supplier

The KPIs, criteria within each KPI, and frequency of performance evaluations are communicated to  the Supplier outside  'SAP  Ariba'.  The  'Project  Owner'  marks  the  task 'Completed'  after communicating with the Supplier .

## 5) Execute 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey'

The  'Supplier  Performance  Input  Collection  Survey'  gets  automatically  published  as  per  the recurrence  set  by  the  'Project  Owner'  while  completing  the  'Overview  Form'.  The  'Project Owner' is intimated about the upcoming survey to make any required changes to the survey rules, content, and participants, for the upcoming evaluation cycle.

<!-- image -->

The  survey  participants  must  provide  their  responses  against  each  question  provided  in  the survey within 'SAP Ariba'.

## 6) Review and publish 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'

'SAP  Ariba'  generates  the  'Supplier  Performance  Scorecard'  based  on  the  survey  responses received, automatically. The 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' provides Supplier scores against each KPI and indicates the areas of improvement (KPIs where target grade is not met).

The 'Project Owner' reviews and publishes the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' for the other 'Project Groups' members to view in 'SAP Ariba' and shares it with the Supplier outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## 7) Develop 'Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Plan'

If the Supplier performs satisfactorily on all KPIs (met the target grade), the evaluation cycle may be considered closed, and the 'Project Owner' repeats the entire process for the next evaluation cycle.

If  the Supplier fails  to  perform  satisfactorily  against  any  of  the  KPIs,  the  'Project  Owner' completes the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' document to rectify the performance Below is the structure of the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' document:

## Tab Name

## Description

## 1.  Supplier Performance Management Plan

## 2. Progress report

To identify root cause for low Supplier scores and develop a mitigation plan for the same.

To track progress made on the high priority actions identified in the 'SPM Plan'.

## Table 2.5.6 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' document structure

The 'Project Owner' downloads the 'SPM Plan' document from the 'Documents' tab of the 'SPM Project' and completes the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' tab. The 'Project Owner' may consider the following points while completing the 'SPM Plan' tab:

- a. For  each  KPI  (where Supplier performance  is  lacking),  identify  the  root  cause,  potential impact,  corrective  actions,  owner  of  the  corrective  action,  completion  date  and  ease  of implementation.
- b. Each row should refer to a unique 'Corrective action.'

The  'Project  Owner'  reviews  the  completed  'SPM  Plan',  with  the Supplier, to  finalize  and prioritize the corrective actions to be executed. Based on this review, the corrective actions may be modified, or additional actions may be identified. Relevant changes must be made to the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' tab before uploading it in the 'SPM Project' for review and approval.

<!-- image -->

Only the 'SPM Plan' tab of the document is uploaded for review and approval. The 'Progress Report' tab is not uploaded at this point.

## 8) Obtain approvals for the 'SPM Plan'

The  'SPM  Plan'  is  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  'Approvers'  designated as  per  the  PDoA . 'Approvers'  may  consider following points while reviewing the 'Supplier  Performance Management Plan':

- a. Each row of the 'SPM Plan' tab should refer to a unique corrective action.
- b. The  root  cause  analysis  and  identified  impacts  should  be  accurate  and  based  on  logical, objective criteria.
- c. The corrective actions must address the root cause and mitigate the impact.
- d. The target date for the corrective actions must be realistic.
- e. The  corrective  actions  must  be  aligned  to  the  overall  'Category  Strategy',  'Procurement Strategy', and the Supplier Segment Strategy.

The 'Approvers' may suggest modifications to the plan, which the 'Project Owner' makes and re-submits the plan for approval.

The 'Project Owner' shares the approved 'SPM Plan' with relevant stakeholders for execution and monitoring outside 'SAP Ariba'.

## 2.5.3.(IV) Manage Supplier Performance

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The Manage Supplier Performance process includes execution and closure of the approved 'SPM Plan'.  The  'Project  Owner'  is  advised  to  complete  all  identified  corrective  actions  within  the performance cycle. In case a corrective action could not be completed within the performance cycle, it may be added to the 'SPM Plan' document of the next performance cycle if required.

The purpose of this process is to execute and close the 'SPM Plan'.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Figure 2.5.13 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Manage Supplier Performance

<!-- image -->

## 1) Monitor progress against the 'SPM Plan.'

The progress against the approved 'SPM Plan' is monitored regularly to ensure better Supplier performance in the  next  evaluation cycle.  This monitoring  is managed  entirely  outside 'SAP Ariba' and follows the below steps:

<!-- image -->

- a. Step 1 - The 'Project Owner' fills in the 'Progress Report' tab of the 'SPM Plan' (downloaded in the previous process) with approved high priority corrective actions.
- b. Step 2 - The 'Project Owner' sends this 'Progress Report' tab to individuals executing the 'SPM Plan' to track the progress made against each corrective action.
- c. Step 3 -  The  'Project Owner' monitors the progress made against each corrective action through multiple rounds of inputs, if required.

## 2) Close the 'SPM Plan'

The 'Project Owner' may close the 'SPM Plan' by uploading the updated 'Progress Report' tab in the 'Documents' tab and marking the 'Monitor and Close Plan' task 'Complete'.

## 3) Close the 'SPM Project'

The 'Project Owner' marks the 'SPM Project' 'Completed', through the 'Overview' tab, after the associated 'Contract Workspace' is 'Closed' or 'Expired'.

## 2.6 Requisition to Pay (R2P)

## 2.6.1 Overview

The  Requisition  to  Pay  (R2P)  process  group  consists  of  procedures  for  creation  and  approval  of Purchase Requisitions (PR), Purchase Orders (PO) and Goods/Services/Projects Receipts. It details the procedures for conducting Emergency, Petty Cash, and P-Card purchases and receiving goods/services/projects.

<!-- image -->

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the R2P processes.

Below is an illustration of the R2P Level 3 processes:

<!-- image -->

## 2.6.2 Details of Level 3 Processes

## 2.6.2.(I) Create and Approve PR

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this process is to create and obtain approvals for the Purchase Requisition (PR). The End User creates the PR to request goods/services/projects and obtain necessary approvals for the purchase.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Complete and Submit PR

Obtain approvals for the PR

## Figure 2.6.2 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Create and Approve PR

## 1) Complete and Submit PR

The End-User creates a PR to request goods/services/projects considering (but not limited to):

- a. Existing inventory &amp; requirement forecast.
- b. Suitable category and sub-category.
- c. Technical specifications, scope, and time plan which may be required in the PR.
- d. Budget estimated and reserved for the PR
- e. In case the requirements in the PR exceed the allocated budget, the End-User either arranges for additional budget, in consultation with the Budget Owner , or modifies the requirements in the PR to fit the allocated budget.

## Important Note: A procurement requirement is not to be split into multiple PRs  to bypass approval authorities.

## 2) Obtain approvals for the PR

PR is reviewed and approved by approvers designated as per the PDoA .  These approvers are from the Business , the Finance , and the Procurement .

The Procurement verifies,  if  the  PR  requirements  can  be  met  by  existing  stock/inventory.  If available, the requested goods are issued from the stock/inventory and the PR is cancelled by the End-User . If not available, the PR is reviewed for other details.

If the approvers suggest modifications to the PR, the End-User makes the recommended changes and re-submits the updated PR for approval.

An approved PR leads directly to PO unless the source of supply or conditions of the purchase must first be determined, in which case the 'Sourcing Request' is created by the Procurement for execution of Sourcing.

## 2.6.2.(II) Create and Approve PO

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this process is to create and issue PO to the Supplier which details the terms and conditions of purchase after required approvals. The Supplier also confirms the receipt of the PO as a part of this process.

<!-- image -->

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Figure 2.6.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Create and Approve PO

<!-- image -->

## 1) Create PO

Multiple Purchase Requisitions (PR) may either be consolidated into aggregate PO or single PR may require multiple POs for the following reasons:

- a. Same/Different  Suppliers -  Goods/services/projects  requested  in  the  PR  are  procured through one or multiple Suppliers.
- b. Same/Different Ship to Address -  Goods/services/projects requested in the PR are to be delivered across one or more locations.
- c. Catalogue vs. Non-Catalogue - Goods/services/projects requested in the PR may be partially fulfilled through an existing contract.

## Important Note: An approved PR is not to be split into multiple POs to bypass approval authorities.

A PR may be converted into a PO directly, through an existing contract, or through sourcing and contracting processes. PO is created by the Procurement .

Important Note: Approved PR is verified by the Procurement against existing contracts to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations.

A Purchase Order (PO) includes details defining what the Supplier needs to fulfil the order. The PO serves as an electronic trace defining the purchase. The details relevant for the PO include (but not limited to):

- a. Supplier details
- b. Descriptions, quantities, prices, and discounts on goods/services/projects in the order
- c. Payment terms along with shipment/delivery dates

## 2) Obtain approval for the PO

PO is reviewed and approved by approvers designated as per the PDoA . If the approvers suggest modifications to the PO, the Procurement makes the recommended changes and re-submits the updated PO for approval. Approved PO is sent to the Supplier for delivery of goods/services/projects.

<!-- image -->

## 3) Issue PO to the Supplier

The Supplier confirms  the  receipt  of  the  PO  and  specifies  whether  it  can  provide  the  entire quantities specified in the PO or not, as a part of this process.

In cases where a Supplier can only provide partial quantities, the Procurement can edit the PO for the quantities confirmed by the Supplier . The modified PO needs to go through the approval process explained above.

## 2.6.2.(III) Receive Goods/Services/Projects and Confirm

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The purpose of the receiving process is to accept the goods/services/projects, generate a receipt for the accepted delivery. The process includes quality inspection and management of return of goods to the Suppliers .

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

Receive goods/services /projects and match against PO

Create and approve Goods/Services/ Projects Receipt

## Figure 2.6.6 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Receive Goods/Services/Projects and Confirm

## 1) Receive goods/services/projects and match against PO

The goods received by the End-User or the store/warehouse are reviewed to ensure that the quantity delivered and specifications match with the PO and the delivery documents.

Based on the review, one of the following approaches may be taken:

## a. Delivery Rejection

Delivery of goods may be rejected if the quantity or the specifications do not match with that provided in the PO. In such cases, the discrepancy is communicated to the Procurement and the Supplier. Depending  on  the  reason  for  rejection,  the Supplier either  replaces  the defective/damaged goods or delivers the missing goods.

In case of services/projects, the Supplier is communicated of the deficiency of service against the PO (mapped against milestones, variance from the KPI's/SLA, timelines etc.).

Delivery of goods/services/projects can be rejected completely or partially (e.g., % of goods delivered  are  not  as  per  the  specification  in  the  PO).  In  case  of  partial  rejection,  partial Goods/Services/Projects Receipt is created against the PO.

If required, the Procurement may also fulfil the pending requirement through an alternate Supplier .

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## b. Delivery Acceptance

Delivery of goods is accepted if the quantity and specifications of goods received match with that  provided  in  the  PO.  In  case  of  services/projects,  the End-User provide  inputs  on service/projects delivery with milestones, KPI's/SLA, timelines etc. which is used to provide delivery acceptance.

## 2) Create and approve Goods/Service/Projects Receipt

End-User creates Goods/Service/Projects Receipt reflecting the goods/services/projects accepted upon delivery or post inspection. In case of goods/services/projects with high value , Entity may choose to form a committee to conduct the inspection.

The Goods/Service/Projects Receipt is reviewed by the approvers designated as per the PDoA . In case the approvers suggest modifications to the Goods/Service/Projects Receipt, the End-User makes necessary modifications and re-submits it for approval.

The  Goods/Service/Projects  Receipt  and  PO  are  used  as  reference  documents  for  invoice reconciliation process and authorizing payment to the Supplier .

## 2.7 Risk and Regulation (R&amp;R)

## 2.7.1 Overview

The  Risk  and  Regulation  (R&amp;R)  process  group  consists  of  procedures  for  the  management  of procurement risks and regulatory changes.

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the R&amp;R processes.

Procurement risk  is  defined  as  a  potential  for  failure  of  any  of  the  procurement  processes. Procurement risks may be associated with Supplier , supply chain, and procurement organization as illustrated below:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Risks emerging from Suppliers ' end and are specific to Supplier (e.g., bankruptcies, location change, price increase, quality/delivery failure, mergers and acquisitions etc.)

Risks  emerging  from  unexpected  external  market  events  (e.g., environmental  disasters  causing  supply  chain  disruption,  price  and supply volatility, supply shock, etc.)

Risks  emerging  from  internal  processes/organization  (e.g.,  incorrect approach to market, insufficient procurement resources, absence of category expertise, etc.)

## Figure 2.7.1 Sources of procurement risks

Below is an illustration of the R&amp;R Level 3 processes:

## 2.7.2 'SAP Ariba module' Overview

All R&amp;R procurement processes are enabled through the 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)'. The R&amp;R processes are clubbed into three distinct stages, each of which is enabled through a different risk profiling type (sub-template) within the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)' as illustrated below.

| Risk and Regulations Stages   | Profile Supplier Risk     | Manage Procurement Risks                               | Manage Regulation Change       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Risk Profiling type           | 'Supplier Risk Profiling' | 'Mitigate Risk'                                        | 'Regulation Change'            |

## Figure 2.7.3 R&amp;R processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages

The Profile  Supplier  Risk is  enabled  through  the  'Supplier  Risk  Profiling'  sub-template  within  the 'Knowledge Project  (Supply  Risk)'.  A  'Knowledge  Project  (Supply  Risk)  -  Supplier  Risk  Profiling'  is created at GPO level to profile Suppliers catering to Common Categories, and at each Entity level to profile Suppliers catering to Entity-Specific Categories. If a Supplier caters to Entity-Specific Categories and Common Categories, then the Supplier is profiled both at GPO and Entity level. An SRM Specialist is assigned as the "Project Owner" for the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling'.

The Manage  Procurement  Risk is  enabled  through  the  'Mitigate  Risk'  sub-template  within  the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)'. A 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Mitigate Risk' is created at Entity/GPO level to manage respective procurement risks. An SRM Specialist is assigned as the "Project Owner" for the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Mitigate Risk'.

The Manage  Regulation  Change is  enabled  via  the  'Regulation  Change'  sub-template  within  the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)'. A 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change' is only created at the GPO level. A Risk and Regulations Lead from the GPO is assigned as the "Project Owner" for the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'.

## 2.7.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

## 2.7.3.(I) Profile Supplier Risk

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The Profile Supplier Risk process is conducted periodically, preferably once a year, to identify highrisk Suppliers and optimize the risk mitigation efforts. As per the Supplier Segment Strategy, the risk profiling is conducted for following Suppliers :

- 1) All Strategic and Critical Suppliers.
- 2) Operational Suppliers with spend in the top 80% of the Entity spend.

The purpose of this process is to conduct 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey' and develop risk profile for Suppliers in 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling'.

## Figure 2.7.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Profile Supplier Risk

## 1) Create 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling'

The assigned SRM Specialist creates a 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' by selecting 'Knowledge Project' from the 'SAP Ariba Dashboard', completing the 'Overview Form', selecting the 'Supply Risk Management' template, and selecting 'Supplier Risk Profiling' as the risk profiling type.

The  assigned SRM  Specialist may  link  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Supply  Risk)  -  Supplier  Risk Profiling' to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' by selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  field  in  the  'Overview  Form'. This  helps  in  indicating  the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In case, the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling', the assigned SRM Specialist may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to)  'Overview  Form'  details,  and  if  required,  'Project  Groups'  and  documents  from  the

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling'.

The 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' gets activated upon completion and submission of the 'Overview Form' by the assigned SRM Specialist. This SRM Specialist becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project.

## 2) Prepare and publish 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey'

The 'Project Owner' sets up the 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey' by completing following segments:

## a. Survey Rules

These rules define execution of the survey, such as:

- a1. Timing Rules - define time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

## b. Survey Participants

The Category Managers participate in the 'Supplier Risk Input Collection Survey'. For the categories, where the Category Managers are not assigned, the Contract Administrators and End-Users participate in the survey.

## c. Survey Content

The content of the survey includes a 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document, which is filled by all survey participants. Following is the structure of the document:

| Tab Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supplier Risk Profile   | To obtain details regarding Supplier risk profiles from survey participants and identify high-risk Suppliers.                                                      |
| Risk Profiling Criteria | Reference tab; provides detailed criteria to score the Supplier on Financial, Operational, Environmental, and Legislative Impacts in 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab. |
| Category Taxonomy       | Reference tab; to add level 2 category details in 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab.                                                                                    |

## Table 2.7.1 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document structure

## 3) Respond to 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey'

The Supplier risk profile is determined by assessing following types of Supplier risks:

- a. Financial Risk
- b. Operational Risk
- c. Environmental Risk
- d. Legislative Risk

The detailed evaluation criteria for these risks is provided in the 'Risk Profiling Criteria' tab of the 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document. A higher score implies higher associated risk.

<!-- image -->

Suppliers are evaluated on above mentioned risk types on a five-point scale (0 - No risk, 1 - Low Risk, 2- Medium risk, 3 - High risk, and 4 - Significant risk). Suppliers with a score of 3 (or above) on any of the risk types are considered as high-risk Suppliers .

The 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey' is completed as follows:

## a. For categories managed by Category Managers

The 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document is filled for each category by the respective Category Manager. The Category Manager identifies and assesses the Supplier risk  in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab of the document.

The Category Managers may share this document with the relevant Contract Administrators and End-Users to collate required inputs. The collation of these inputs is managed outside 'SAP Ariba'. In such cases, the Category Manager collates these inputs into one 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document.

## b. For Categories without Category Managers

The 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document is filled by the relevant Contract Administrators and End-Users.

The  survey  participants  upload  the  completed  'Supplier  Risk  Profiling'  document  in  the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' as the survey response.

Important  Note:  While  collating  data  for  their  category,  the  Category  Manager  /  Contract Administrator / End-User are advised to ensure that the entire contracted spend is accounted for in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab.

## 4) Complete 'Supplier Risk Profiling - Consolidated'

The 'Project Owner' collates received survey responses in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab of the 'Supplier Risk Profiling - Consolidated' document and completes the 'High-Risk Suppliers' tab of the document. The 'Project Owner' can download the 'Supplier Risk Profiling - Consolidated' document from the 'Documents' tab.

## 5) Close 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling'

The 'Project Owner' may close the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' from the 'Overview' tab once the 'Supplier Risk Profiling - Consolidated' document has been uploaded in the 'SAP Ariba' and shared with relevant stakeholders.

## 2.7.3.(IV) Implement Regulation Change

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The Manage Regulation Change process is conducted as and when a regulation change, effecting the Procurement , is introduced. The process includes development, approval, and implementation of a

<!-- image -->

'Regulation  Change'  plan  and  is  managed  entirely  by  the  GPO.  Activities  may  be  assigned  to stakeholders from affected Entities, as per the 'Regulation Change' plan.

The  purpose  of  this  process  is  to  prepare,  approve,  execute,  and  close  the  'Regulation  Change' document.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

Assess regulation change for impact on Procurement

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Complete the 'Regulation Change' document

Obtain approvals for the 'Regulation Change' document

Monitor 'Regulation Change' implementation

Create 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'

Close 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'

## Figure 2.7.10 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Implement Regulation Change

## 1) Assess regulation change for impact on Procurement

The Risk and Regulation Lead reviews and assess potential impacts of the upcoming regulation changes on Procurement .  In  case of potential impacts, the Risk and regulation Lead creates, manages, executes and closes the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'.

## 2) Create 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'

Assigned Risk  and  Regulation  Lead creates  a  'Knowledge  Project  (Supply  Risk)  -  Regulation Change'  by  selecting  'Knowledge  Project'  from  the  'SAP  Ariba  Dashboard',  completing  the 'Overview  Form',  selecting  the  'Supply  Risk  Management'  template,  and  selecting  the 'Regulation Change' as the risk profiling type.

Assigned Risk and Regulation Lead from GPO may link the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) Regulation  Change'  to  a  previously  executed  'Knowledge  Project  (Supply  Risk)  -  Regulation Change'  by  selecting  the  'Predecessor  Project'  field  in  the  'Overview  Form'.  This  helps  in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

In  case,  the  'Knowledge  Project  (Supply  Risk)  -  Regulation  Change'  created  is  identical  (or similar) to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change', the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'.

The 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change' gets activated upon completion and submission of the 'Overview Form' by the assigned Risk and Regulation Lead .  This Risk and Regulation Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project.

<!-- image -->

## 3) Complete the 'Regulation Change' document

The 'Project Owner' downloads, completes, and uploads the 'Regulation Change' document provided in the 'Documents' tab. Any inputs required to complete the document are collated offline. Below is the structure of the 'Regulation Change' document:

| Section Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Regulation Overview             | Provides overview details of the regulation change (such as regulation no., description, categories impacted, products impacted, etc.)                     |
| 2. Impact on Procurement           | Details actions to be taken for compliance with associated timelines, dependencies, entities affected, and budget requirement                              |
| 3. Implementation Activities       | Detailed activities to be conducted along with RACI Matrix                                                                                                 |
| 4. Communication Plan              | Details of all communications required to monitor and execute the regulation change, including persons targeted, dates and key messages to be communicated |
| 5. Potential Risks and Issues      | Details all potential risks in the implementation of the regulation change                                                                                 |
| 6. Implementation Plan - timelines | Details timelines for all activities listed in the 'Implementation Activities'                                                                             |
| 7. Regulation Change Tracking      | Monitors progress made by each affected entity and progress made against each 'Implementation Activity.'                                                   |

## Table 2.7.8 'Regulation Change' document structure

The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Regulation Change' template provided in the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change' or other approved template covering the required elements.

## 4) Obtain approvals for the 'Regulation Change' document

The completed 'Regulation Change' document is uploaded in the 'Documents' tab for approval by 'Approvers' designated by the PDoA .

If 'Approvers' recommend changes to the 'Regulation Change' document, the 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits it for approval.

The approved 'Regulation Change' document is shared with the relevant stakeholders to execute the identified activities.

## 5) Monitor 'Regulation Change' implementation

The 'Project Owner' initiates periodic reviews of the 'Regulation Change' document to monitor the  progress.  Relevant  stakeholders  provide  a  progress  report  and  highlight  any  issues/ deviations in the 'Regulation Change Tracking' section of the 'Regulation Change' document.

With each review, the 'Project Owner' uploads an updated version of the 'Regulation Change' document in the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'.

<!-- image -->

## 6) Close 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change'

The 'Project Owner' closes the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change' from the 'Overview' tab once all the tasks in the 'Regulation Change' document are completed, and the regulation change has been implemented.

## Important Note: This process is only applicable to procurement Suppliers.

Below is an illustration of the Supplier MDM processes:

Figure 2.8.1 Supplier MDM - Procurement Processes (Level 3)

## 2.8.1.(I) Supplier Classification

The onboarding process of a Supplier varies  with  the  type  of Supplier . Suppliers can  be  broadly classified into the following two categories:

## i. Abu Dhabi Suppliers (AD-DED)

This category includes Suppliers that operate in the Abu Dhabi &amp; have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license.

## ii. Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED)

This category includes Suppliers that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such Suppliers may further be classified into:

- 1) Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone)
- 2) Foreign Suppliers

The Supplier Registration Team , at the Department of Government Support (DGS), is responsible for onboarding Suppliers and maintaining the Supplier Master Database.

## 2.8.2 'SAP Ariba Module' Overview

The  Supplier  MDM  process  group  is  enabled  through  the  'SAP  Ariba  Supplier  Lifecycle  and Performance (SLP) module'. The module covers the following stages:

<!-- image -->

Figure 2.8.2 Supplier MDM processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages

| SLP Stages         | Registration Request                      | Supplier Registration                                | Supplier Qualification                                         | Supplier Deactivation/ Reactivation             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Business Processes | 1. Initiate Supplier Registration Request | 2. Register Supplier 3. Update Supplier Registration | 4. Qualify/Disqualify Supplier 5. Identify Preferred Suppliers | 6. Deactivate Suppliers 7. Reactivate Suppliers |

<!-- image -->

The Registration Request enables Suppliers or Entities to raise the 'Registration Request'. It enables identification of duplicate requests.

The Supplier Registration enables Suppliers to complete and submit the 'Registration Questionnaires' to be reviewed by the Supplier Registration Team . Registration of a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database is necessary for the Supplier to participate in Limited Tenders.

The Supplier Qualification enables Suppliers to complete and submit the 'Qualification Questionnaire' to be reviewed by the Supplier Registration Team . Qualification of a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database is necessary for the Supplier to  conduct business activities, including (but not limited to) receiving award, PO and submitting invoices.

The Supplier Qualification also includes process to disqualify a Supplier , if required. Suppliers can be blacklisted through the disqualification process.

The Supplier Deactivation/Reactivation enables the Supplier Registration Team to deactivate/reactivate the Suppliers , as required. A 'Deactivated' Supplier is not eligible to conduct any business activity or participate in any Limited Tender.

## 2.8.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

## 2.8.3.(I) Initiate Supplier Request

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The Supplier onboarding process  starts  with  a  valid  'Registration  Request'.  The  purpose  of  this process  is  to  create,  review,  and  approve  the  'Registration  Request'  and  ensure  that Supplier records are not duplicated in the Supplier Master Database.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.8.3 Process Flow &amp; Key Tasks - Initiate Supplier Request

## 1) Raise 'Registration Request'

Below is an illustration of how the 'Registration Request' and registration requirements change based on the Supplier classification:

<!-- image -->

Figure 2.8.4 Supplier Classification

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- a. AD-DED Suppliers raise  a  'Supplier  Self-Registration Request' by opening the 'SAP Ariba Supplier Self-Registration Request link' and completing and submitting the 'SelfRegistration Request form'.
- b. Non- AD-DED Suppliers request an Entity to raise an 'Entity Raised Supplier Request', on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into 'SAP Ariba Supplier Entity-Request Page', completes  and  submits  the  'Entity  Raised  Request  Form',  and  uploads  the  required documents.

The Entity user should validate the information provided by the Supplier before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the Non - AD-DED Supplier cannot be met by a Supplier that holds an Abu Dhabi DED license.

The  Entity  user , while  completing  the  'Entity-Raised  Request  Form'  must  confirm  the expected spend with the Supplier . In case of Foreign Suppliers , this expected spend decides the attestation requirements.

## 2) Receive and assign 'Registration Request'

The Supplier Registration Team Lead , upon receiving on the 'Registration Request', assigns the request to a Supplier Data Management Specialist for review and approval.

## 3) Review and approve/deny 'Registration Request'

The Supplier Data Management Specialist reviews the 'Registration Request' for the following:

- a. Duplicate  'Registration  Request'  'SAP  Ariba'  automatically  highlights  if  the  received 'Registration Request' is a duplicate and highlights potential matches using the following fields:
2. a1. 'Company Name'
3. a2. 'Commercial/Industrial License Number'
4. a3. 'Tax Registration Number'

In case 'SAP Ariba' highlights potential matches for a 'Registration Request', the Supplier Data Management Specialist checks for the following points, across potential duplicates:

- b. Suppliers with the same 'Company Name' appear as potential matches in 'SAP Ariba' . In this case, the Supplier Data Management Specialist should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License  Number'  and  'Tax  Registration  Number'  with  that  of  the  potential  matches  to determine if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate.
- c. Suppliers related to each other (e.g., parent and child companies) may have the same 'Tax Registration Number'. Such Suppliers appear as potential matches in 'SAP Ariba'. In such cases, the Supplier Data Management Specialist should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' with that of the potential matches to determine if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate.

<!-- image -->

Important Note: Different 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' implies a different Supplier. A Supplier with multiple commercial/industrial licenses raises a separate 'Registration Request' for each of the commercial/industrial license.

Based on the above activities, the Supplier Data Management Specialist determines if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate and reject the same in such cases. In case 'SAP Ariba' does not highlight a duplicate for a 'Registration Request', the Supplier Data Management Specialist proceeds to further evaluation of the 'Registration Request'.

- d. Valid 'Registration Request' -  In  case  the  'Registration Request'  is  not  a  duplicate,  the Supplier  Data  Management  Specialist validates if  the  information  provided  in  the 'Registration Request' is accurate and matches the information in the documents provided .

In  case  the  'Registration  Request'  is  denied,  the Supplier  Data  Management  Specialist provides a valid rationale, and the Supplier or Entity may re-start the process.

If the details provided in the 'Registration Request' are found accurate, the Supplier Data Management Specialist approves the request and assigns himself/herself as the 'Supplier Manager ' for the Supplier .  The 'Supplier Manager ' acts as the single point of contact for the Supplier during the registration and qualification processes.

As soon as the 'Registration Request' is 'Approved', the Supplier receives an invitation to register with 'SAP Ariba Network'. This email includes the 'SAP Ariba Registration Link'.

Important  Note:  In  case  the  'Registration  Request'  is  raised  by  the  Entity,  the  Entity  users  is notified about the request status (approval/denied).

Suitable communication channels are established to support Suppliers during the registration process. The Supplier Registration Team must only use these channels to communicate with the Suppliers . The channels set up are:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Helpdesk Email

Supplier Registration team may also communicate with the Supplier using the helpdesk email: srs@dgs.gov.ae

Figure 2.8.5 'SAP ARIBA - Communication Channels'

<!-- image -->

The 'Request Additional Info' functionality is only active once the Supplier has created an 'SAP Ariba Network Account'. Hence it is not available during the Initiate Supplier Request process.

## Figure 2.8.7 Process Flow &amp; Key Tasks - Register Supplier

## 1) Create 'SAP Ariba Network Standard Account'

Using the 'Registration Link' from 'SAP Ariba', Suppliers create an 'SAP Ariba Network Standard Account'. Suppliers don't have to pay any fees to maintain this account. Once the account is created, Suppliers have an email ID and password to access the account.

Suppliers may use their existing 'SAP Ariba Network Account'.

Suppliers already  registered  in  'ORACLE  ADERP'  need  to  re-register  in  the  Supplier  Master Database, maintained by the DGS in 'SAP Ariba.

## 2) Complete and submit the 'Registration Questionnaires'

The Supplier logs  into  the  'SAP  Ariba  Network  Standard  account'  and  views  the  following 'Registration Questionnaires' to be filled and submitted:

## a. 'General Registration Questionnaire'

The 'General Registration Questionnaire' is used to obtain information such as (but not limited to) 'License and tax information', 'Contact details', 'Goods &amp; Services', 'Authorized Representatives', and 'Ownership Details'.

Complete 'Internal

Questionnaire'

<!-- image -->

While filling the 'General Registration Questionnaire', Foreign Suppliers must download, review, and agree to the 'Attestation Requirements' elaborated in point (c) below.

## b. 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire'

The Supplier fills the 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire' upon completion and submission of the 'General Registration Questionnaire'. The 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire' is used to obtain essential financial information such as (but not limited to) 'Payment Information' and 'Primary / Secondary Bank Details'.

## c. Attestation requirements

A summary of the attestation requirements is illustrated below:

<!-- image -->

## Figure 2.8.8 Supplier Registration - Attestation requirements

To be registered as a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database, all Foreign Suppliers must get certain documents attested by the UAE embassy in the country of their establishment.

## c1. Documents to be attested :

- c11. Commercial/Industrial License or Valid Justification on Company letterhead

<!-- image -->

- I) Hotels
2. II) Other travel modes (such as Road/Rail transportation)
3. III) Training Fees for universities and training programs
4. IV) Telecommunication services
- V) Goods/services on Presidential Flights

All Foreign  Suppliers must  download,  review  and  agree  to  the  'Attestation  Requirements' document, as applicable.

## 3) Review and approve 'General Registration Questionnaire'

The  'Supplier  Manager'  reviews  the  'General  Registration  Questionnaire'  to  validate  the information provided, check if attestation requirements are met (if applicable), and categories requested are valid. Once validated, the 'Supplier Manager' approves the 'General Registration Questionnaire' for the Supplier .

Important Note: UNSPSC Level 2 Categories mentioned in the 'General Registration Questionnaire' must be covered by the commercial/industrial license of the Supplier and must be aligned with the goods/services the Supplier intends to supply.

If required, the 'Supplier Manager' may request the Supplier to modify information provided in the 'General Registration Questionnaire' through the 'Request Additional Info' functionality in 'SAP Ariba'.

Once the 'General Registration Questionnaire' is approved, the review of the 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire' and completion of the 'Internal Questionnaire' are initiated in parallel.

## 4) Review and approve 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire'

The  'Bank  Information  Specialist'  (within  the Supplier  Registration  Team )  ensures  that  the information provided in the 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire' is accurate, and the attestation requirements are met (if applicable).

If required, the 'Bank Information Specialist' may request the Supplier to modify information provided  in  the  'Payment  and  Bank  Questionnaire'  through  the  'Request  Additional  Info' functionality in 'SAP Ariba'.

## 5) Complete 'Internal Questionnaire'

The 'Internal Questionnaire' is an 'SAP Ariba' template that decides the Supplier enablement and restrictions.

Based on the approved 'Registration Questionnaires', the 'Supplier Manager' adds information about the Supplier such as goods/services categories, Entities, ADERP Number (if applicable), and Related Supplier ID (if applicable) in the 'Internal Questionnaire'.

<!-- image -->

AD-DED  Suppliers are  'Registered'  for  all  Entities.  While Non  -  AD-DED  Suppliers are 'Registered' for the Entity raising the 'Entity Raised Request' for the Supplier .  'Registered' Suppliers can participate in tenders across Entities and categories.

Entities specified in the 'Internal Questionnaire' can conduct business (i.e., raise PO) with the Supplier after it is 'Qualified'.

## 2.8.3.(III) Update Supplier Registration

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The Supplier can update the information provided in either of the 'Registration Questionnaires', as required, at any point in time. Any such update is reviewed by the 'Supplier Manager' or the 'Bank Information Specialist' (as applicable) and, if validated, reflected in the Supplier profile.

The purpose of this process is to update the information provided by the Supplier in 'Registration Questionnaires',  as  required  and  enable  a  'Registered' Non  -  AD-DED  Supplier for  additional Entities.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key tasks

Update the required information (Supplier)

## Figure 2.8.10 Process Flow &amp; Key Tasks - Update Supplier Registration

## 1) Open the 'Registration Questionnaire'

The Supplier may need to update the information provided in the 'Registration Questionnaires' due to multiple reasons including (but not limited to):

- a. Add/modify a category in the 'Registration Questionnaire'
- b. Modify information due to an update at the Supplier end
- c. Modification in the 'Registration Questionnaire' template due to a Regulation Change.

The Supplier logs  into  the  'SAP  Ariba  Network  Standard  Account'  and  updates  the  relevant information in the 'General Registration Questionnaire' and 'Payment and Bank Questionnaire', as required.

The 'Registration Questionnaires' close for further modifications after 365 days of no activity. In this case, the Supplier sends a request to the Supplier Registration Team (via GPO Helpdesk) to re-open the 'Registration Questionnaires'.

## 2) Update the required information

The Supplier modifies/updates  the  information  provided  (including  updated  documents,  if required) and submits the relevant 'Registration Questionnaire(s)' for review and approval.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Add Entity to 'Registered' Non AD-DED Supplier

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Important Note: Changes in the 'Company name' or 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' of the Supplier are not allowed. The Supplier should raise a new 'Registration Request' if modifications in these fields are required.

## 3) Review and validate the updated information

Once  submitted,  the  modified  'Registration  Questionnaires'  are  reviewed  and  approved,  as explained in section 2.8.3.(II)ii.3) and section 2.8.3.(II)ii.4) . If required, 'Internal Questionnaire' is updated as explained in section 2.8.3.(II)ii.5) .

## 4) Trigger the Supplier 'Qualification'

If the Supplier has added another category of goods/services while updating information in the 'Registration  Questionnaires',  the  'Supplier  Manager'  qualifies  the Supplier for  the  added category. The criteria and process for qualifying a Supplier are explained in section 2.8.3.(IV).

## 5) Add Entities to 'Registered' Non - AD-DED Supplier

An  Entity  can  create  a  quick  survey  from  the  'SAP  Ariba  dashboard'  to  activate  an  already 'Registered' Non - Abu Dhabi DED Supplier for itself. In such cases, the 'Supplier Manager' asks the Supplier to update the 'General Registration Questionnaire' to include the Entity.

The  Entity  user  provides  the  details  of  the Non-AD-DED  Supplier to  be  activated,  adds  the 'Supplier Manager' as the survey participant, and submits the survey. Upon receiving the survey, the 'Supplier Manager' asks the Supplier to update the 'General Registration Questionnaire' and adds this Entity to the 'Internal Questionnaire' of the Non-AD-DED Supplier .

## Figure 2.8.12 Process Flow &amp; Key Tasks - Qualify/Disqualify Suppliers

## 1) Send 'Qualification Questionnaire'

The  'Supplier  Manager'  completes  the  'Pre-Qualification  Questionnaire'  and  specifies  the 'Category', 'Region' and 'Entity' for which the Supplier is to be 'Qualified'.

<!-- image -->

The 'Supplier Manager'  sends  the  'Qualification Questionnaire'  to the Supplier . The 'Qualification  Questionnaire'  contains  sections  for  the Supplier to  provide  declarations  with respect to 'Business Standing', 'Financial Standing', and 'Previous Experience'.

Suppliers can be 'Qualified' for multiple categories using a single 'Qualification Questionnaire'. In the 'Pre -Qualification Questionnaire', the 'Supplier Manager' has an option to add multiple categories in the 'Category' field.

## 2) Complete &amp; submit 'Qualification Questionnaire'

The Supplier receives and responds to all sections in the 'Qualification Questionnaire'.

## 3) Review responses &amp; mark Supplier 'Qualified'

The responses to 'Qualification Questionnaire' are reviewed by the 'Supplier Manager' and, subsequently, the Supplier Data Management Lead . The Supplier status changes to 'Qualified' (automatically)  once  the  'Qualification  Questionnaire'  is  'Approved'  by  the Supplier  Data Management Lead.

The 'Supplier Manager' (or Supplier Data Management Lead ) may ask the Supplier for more information while reviewing the 'Qualification Questionnaire' through the 'Request Additional Info' functionality in 'SAP Ariba'.

The 'Supplier Manager' may provide an 'Expiry Date' for the 'Qualified' status of the Supplier , in line with the commercial/industrial license expiration date. In such a case, once the 'Expiry Date' has passed, the Supplier status changes to 'Qualification Expired'.

## 4) Disqualify Supplier

Suppliers can be blacklisted using disqualification functionality.

The Entity user can create the 'Supplier Disqualification Survey' from the 'SAP Ariba dashboard' to request blacklisting of a Supplier.

The 'Supplier Manager' can disqualify a Supplier through the ' Supplier profile' page provided in  'SAP  Ariba'.  The  'Supplier  Manager'  provides  a  'Disqualification  Start  Date'  and  a 'Disqualification End Date' while disqualifying a Supplier . When the 'Disqualification Expiry Date' has passed, the 'Supplier Manager' may re-initiate the qualification process for the Supplier, as explained above.

The guidelines for Supplier blacklisting are provided in section 12 of the Procurement Standards.

## 2.9 Item Master Data Management

## 2.9.1 Overview

Item Master Data Management (Item MDM) process group consists of procedures associated with the creation and maintenance of records of items representing unique goods/services. The Item Master Data provides accurate, consistent and complete record of goods/services procured across Entities. The responsibility for maintaining Item Master Data is centralized with changes to the records initiated by the Entities.

Following  guidelines  must  be  adhered  to  during  creation  and  maintenance  of  the  Item  Master Database:

- 1) Records of Item Master Data are created for frequently purchased goods/services.
- 2) Each item is identified by a unique code in the Item Master Data.
- 3) The record of each item contains (but not limited to):
- a. Item Code
- b. Description
- c. Item type
- d. Item group
- e. Unit of Measurement
- f. Unit price.

<!-- image -->

- 4) Each item belongs to one of the UNSPSC Level 3 'Classes'. UNSPSC classification is explained in section 1.2.2 .
- 5) Item Master Database is regularly cleansed to identify and remove duplicate records and rectify incomplete and inconsistent records, to ensure data integrity.

## 2.9.2 Details of the level 3 Processes

## 2.9.2.(I) Add/modify/Delete Item record

Entity requestor can raise a request to add/modify an item record in the Item Master Data though GPO Helpdesk. The raised request must be approved by the supervisor of the requestor. The Helpdesk forwards the request to the Item Master Data team.

The Item Master Data team reviews the raised request for completeness, accuracy, and duplication.

In case the request is duplicate, the Item Master Data team rejects the request and communicate the same to the GPO helpdesk. The GPO helpdesk communicates the same to the Entity requestor.

In  case  the  request  if  inaccurate  or  incomplete,  the  Item  Master  Data  team  seeks  additional information from the Entity requestor (through Helpdesk).

If  case  the  request  is  accurate,  complete,  and  valid,  the  Item  Master  Data  team  obtains  required approvals as per the PDoA to create/modify/delete the record, depending upon the request. Once approved,  the  Item  Master  Data  completes  executes  the  request  in  the  Item  master  Data  and communicates the same to the GPO Helpdesk. The GPO Helpdesk communicates the completion of request to the Entity requestor.

Please refer to Appendix 3.1 - 2.10.3.(I) Enable/Modify/Deactivate User for the process map.

## 2.10.3.(II) Delegate User/Reset 'SAP Ariba' Password

## i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this process is to enable the Entity requestor to delegate 'SAP Ariba' responsibilities to another user and reset 'SAP Ariba' password.

<!-- image -->

Important Note: Please note that a User can self-reset the password directly from the website. This process is only to be followed in case the self-reset does not work.

## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<!-- image -->

(User Enablement Team)

## Figure 2.10.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Delegate User / Reset 'SAP Ariba' Password

## 1) Raise Request

The Entity requestor sends an email to the GPO Helpdesk requesting delegation of 'SAP Ariba' access to another user or a password reset.

## 2) Implement request in 'SAP Ariba'

The GPO Helpdesk forwards the request to the 'User Enablement Team' via email. The 'User Enablement Team' takes the required action in 'SAP Ariba' and confirms the closure of the request to GPO Helpdesk. The GPO Helpdesk confirms the same to the Entity requestor.

In case of a delegation request, the 'User Enablement Team' sends an email to the delegatee (person to whom responsibilities have been delegated to) with details of the delegation.

## 3) Reset Password

In case of the password reset request, the Entity requestor receives an auto-generated email containing instructions to set a new password, once the 'User Enablement Team' has reset the password in 'SAP Ariba'.

## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                 | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requestor            | 1. Submit password reset request to GPO Helpdesk via email. 2. Submit 'SAP Ariba' access delegation request to GPO Helpdesk, via email. 3. Reset 'SAP Ariba' password as per the instructions received in the email. |
| GPO Helpdesk         | 4. Receive requests from 'Requestor' and communicate to 'User Enablement Team'. 5. Receive confirmation from 'User Enablement Team' and communicate to 'Requestor'.                                                  |
| User Enablement Team | 6. Complete request in 'SAP Ariba'. 7. Communicate request completion to GPO Helpdesk. 8. Inform delegatee of the delegation done (in case of delegation request).                                                   |
